<p class="first">&ldquo;<i>We are likely to think of the savage as a
freakish creature, all moods&mdash;at one moment a friend, at the next
moment a fiend. So he might be were it not for the social drill imposed
by his customs. So he is, if you destroy his customs, and expect him
nevertheless to behave as an educated and reasonable being. Given,
then, a primitive society in a healthy and uncontaminated condition,
its members will invariably be found to be on the average more
law-abiding, as judged from the stand-point of their own law, than is
the case in any civilized state.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Of course, if we have to do with a primitive society on
the down-grade&mdash;and very few that have been
&lsquo;civilizaded,&rsquo; as John Stuart Mill terms it, at the hands
of the white man are not on the down-grade&mdash;its disorganized and
debased custom no longer serves a vital function. But a healthy society
is bound, in a wholesale way, to have a healthy custom.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">There is no law so strong as custom. How much more
universal, willing, and spontaneous is obedience to the customary law
that a necktie shall be worn with a stiff collar than is obedience to
the ordained law against expectoration on sidewalks; notwithstanding
that the latter has more basis in consideration of the public weal and
even in aesthetics.</p>
<p>This little paper shows how a people having no vestige of
constituted authority or government, and therefore living in literal
anarchy, dwell in comparative peace and security of life and property.
This is owing to the fact of their homogeneity and to the fact that
their law is based entirely on custom and taboo.</p>
<p>The Ifugaos are a tribe of barbarian head-hunters. Nevertheless,
after living among them for a period of eight years, I am fully
satisfied that never, even before our government was established over
them, was the loss of life from violence of all descriptions nearly so
great among them as it is among ourselves. I do not, however, wish to
be understood as advocating their state of society as ideal, or as in
any way affording more than a few suggestions possibly to our own
law-makers. Given dentists and physicians, however, I doubt gravely if
any society in existence could afford so much advantage in the way of
happiness and true freedom as does that of the Ifugaos.</p>
<p>But we must realize that probably neither security of the individual
life nor even happiness are the chief ends of existence. The progress
and evolution of our people are much more important in all probability,
and this seems to demand the sacrifice of ease and freedom and of much
happiness on the part of the individuals composing our society.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments are due first to my teacher and friend, Professor
Frederick Starr, for his encouragement and assistance, and, above all,
for his inculcation of respect for and tolerance toward customs other
than our own.</p>
<p>Captain Jeff D. Gallman, whose work among the Ifugaos stands to the
credit of our government of the Philippines second to that of no other
man in the archipelago, assisted me in many ways. He is a man learned
in the &ldquo;lore of men,&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. David P. Barrows, now Major Barrows, also rendered me

Waterman and Mr. E. W. Gifford, have read the manuscript and proofs and
have made valuable suggestions which are incorporated in the paper as

<h3 class="main">The Ifugaos</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Philippine ethnologists generally agree to the
hypothesis that the Negritos, a race of little blacks, remnants of
which now inhabit mountain regions of many of the larger islands, were
the original inhabitants of the Philippine Archipelago. They advance
the hypothesis that these little blacks were driven by Malay immigrants
from their former homes in the fertile plains to the mountains; and
that these first Malay invaders were driven from the lowlands into the
mountain regions by succeeding immigrations of Malays superior to them
in organization and weapons.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1745src" href=
"#xd20e1745" name="xd20e1745src">1</a> By and by, no one cares to
hazard how long afterward, the Spaniards came. They christianized the
lowlanders, except the Mohammedan populations of Mindanao and Sulu. But
at the time of the American occupation the mountaineer descendants of
the first immigration, for the most part, had not received the
spiritual ministrations of Her Most Catholic Majesty&rsquo;s
missionaries, on account of the inaccessible character of their
habitat. True, garrisons and missions had been established in a few
localities among them; but owing to the scattered character of the
population, the independent spirit of the people, their natural
conservatism, and the lack of tact and consideration on the part of the
Spanish officials and missionaries, practically no progress had been
made in christianizing or civilizing them.</p>
<p>The great majority of the non-Mohammedan, non-Christian Malays
inhabit the island of Luzon. The Luzon non-Christian tribes and their
estimated numbers are: Apayaos, 16,000; Benguet Igorots, 25,000; Bontoc
Igorots, 50,000; Wild Gaddanes, 4000; Ifugaos, 120,000; Ilongots, 6000;
Kalingas, 60,000; Tingianes, 30,000; Lepanto Igorots, 35,000; total,
nearly a quarter million. All these tribes inhabit the mountain ranges
of the northern third of the island.</p>
<p>The habitat of the Ifugaos is situated in about the center of the
area inhabited by the non-Christian tribes. In point of travel-time,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1755" href="#xd20e1755" name=
"xd20e1755">9</a>]</span>as we say in the Philippines, for one equipped
with the usual amount of baggage, Ifugao-land is about as far from
Manila as New York from Constantinople. To the northeast are the Wild
Gaddan, to the north the Bontoc Igorot, to the northwest, west, and
southwest the Lepanto and Benguet Igorots; to the east, across the wide
uninhabited river basin of the Cagayan, are the Ilongots. This
geographic isolation has tended to keep the Ifugao culture relatively
pure and uninfluenced by contact with the outside world. Two or three
military posts were fitfully maintained in Ifugao by the Spaniards
during the last half century of their <span class="corr" id="xd20e1757"
title="Source: sovereignity">sovereignty</span>; but the lives of the
natives were little affected thereby.</p>
<p>Ifugao men wear clouts and Ifugao women loin cloths, or short
skirts, reaching from the waist to the knees. Wherever they go the men
carry spears. Both sexes ornament their persons with gold ornaments,
beads, agates, mother of pearl, brass ornaments, and so forth. Ifugao
houses, while small, are substantially built, of excellent materials,
and endure through many generations.</p>
<p>It may safely be said that the Ifugaos have constructed the most
extensive and the most admirable terraces for rice culture to be found
anywhere in the world. The Japanese terraces, which excite the
admiration of tens of thousands of tourists every year, are not to be
compared with them. On these steep mountains that rise from sea-level
to heights of six to eight thousand feet&mdash;mountains as steep
probably as any in the world&mdash;there have been carved out, with
wooden spades and wooden crowbars, terraces that run like the crude but
picturesque &ldquo;stairsteps&rdquo; of a race of giants, from the
bases almost to the summits. Some of these terrace walls are fifty feet
high. More than half are walled with stone. Water to flood these
terraces is retained by a little rim of earth at the outer margin. The
soil is turned in preparation for planting with a wooden spade. No
mountain is too steep to be terraced, if it affords an unfailing supply
of water for irrigation. The Ifugao, too, makes clearings on his
mountains in which he plants sweet potatoes, and numerous less
important vegetables. Without his knowing it, he bases his agriculture
on scientific principles (to an extent that astounds the white man) and
he tends his crops so skillfully and artistically that he probably has
no peer as a mountain husbandman.</p>
<p>Of political organization the Ifugao has nothing&mdash;not even a
suggestion. Notwithstanding, he has a well-developed system of laws.
This absolute lack of political government has brought it about that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1766" href="#xd20e1766" name=
"xd20e1766">10</a>]</span>the Ifugao is a consummate diplomat. After an
eight years&rsquo; residence among them, I am convinced that the
Ifugaos got along very well in the days before a foreign government was
established among them. Through countless generations the Ifugao who
has survived and prospered has been the one who has carried his point,
indeed, but has carried it without involving himself in serious trouble
with his fellows.</p>
<p>The Ifugao&rsquo;s religion is a mixture of an exceedingly complex
polytheism, ancestor worship, and a mythology that is used as an
instrument of magic. His religion seems to be far more highly developed
than that of the other non-Christian tribes.</p>
<p>Attempts made by Spain to colonize the Ifugao in the lowlands
invariably met with failure. The Ifugao is a hillman, and loves his
hills. He is of an independent nature and cannot stand confinement. A
great many prisoners jailed by American officials have courted death
rather than endure incarceration.</p>
<p>While there are well defined tribal divisions that mark off the
various mountain-Malay populations of northern Luzon, the cultures of
all of the tribes are basically similar. Numerous parallelisms, too,
are found with the lowland Filipinos, even now, in features of daily
life, religion, taboo, law, and marital relation. The dialects of all
the tribes inhabiting the islands are branches of the great family of
Malay languages&mdash;languages spoken over more than half the
circumference of the globe. The linguistic differences that exist
between the mountain and the lowland tribes seem to be not much greater
than the linguistic differences between the various mountain tribes
themselves.</p>
<p>Many things lead us to believe that the culture of the Ifugaos is
very old. We have to do with a people who possess both as individuals
and collectively a most remarkable memory. Ifugao rich men lend to
considerable numbers of clients and others every year during the
&ldquo;hungry time&rdquo;&mdash;to these, varying numbers of bundles of
rice, to this one a skein of yarn, to that one a pig, and to another
again a chicken. All these bargains and their amounts and their varying
terms, our wealthy Ifugao remembers, unaided by any system of writing
or other artificial means. Many Ifugaos know their ancestors back to
the tenth or even the fourteenth generation, and, in addition, the
brothers and sisters of these ancestors. If we consider the racial or
tribal memory of these people, we find a mythology fully as voluminous
as that of the Greeks. But the Ifugaos have no recollections of having
ever migrated. Unless they have lived for many centuries in their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1776" href="#xd20e1776" name=
"xd20e1776">11</a>]</span>present habitat, it seems certain that they
would have retained at least in mythical form the memory of their
migration.</p>
<p>Another consideration that is significant lies in a comparison of
the rate of rice-field building in these peaceful times, when such work
is not hindered but instead vigorously stimulated by the government,
with the amount of such work accomplished by past generations. One who
stands on some jutting spur of the mountain-side in Asin, Sapao, or
Benaue can scarcely help being impressed with the feeling that he is
looking upon a work of tens of centuries. Any calculation must be based
on vague and hazardous figures of course, but, without having any
theories to prove, and making due allowance for increased rate of
building during peaceful times and for the pressure of the needs of
increased population, from a comparison of the estimated area of
voluntary rice-field building with the areas already constructed, I
come to the conclusion that the Ifugaos must have lived in their
present habitat for at least two thousand years, and I believe that
these figures are too small.</p>

<div id="ch1.1" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Sources of Ifugao Law and its Present Status of
Development</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ifugaos have no form of writing: there is,
consequently, no written law. They have no form of political
government: there is, therefore, no constitutional or statutory law.
Inasmuch as they have no courts or judges, there is no law based on
judicial decisions.</p>
<p>Ifugao law has two sources of origin: taboo (which is essentially
religious) and custom. The customary law is the more important from the
greater frequency of its application.</p>
<p id="s1">1. <i>Relation of taboo to law.</i>&mdash;The Ifugao word
for taboo is <i>paniyu</i>. The root, which appears under the varying
forms <i>iyu</i>, <i>iho</i>, <i>iyao</i>, and <i>ihao</i>, means in
general &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; The prefix <i>pan</i>
denotes instrumentality or manner. The word <i>paniyu</i> means both by
derivation and in use, &ldquo;bad way of doing,&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil
way.&rdquo; By far the greater number of taboos have their origin in
magic. A very large number of them concern the individual, or those
closely related to him by blood ties, and for this reason have no place
in a discussion of law. Thus a pregnant woman may not wear a string of
beads, since the beads form a closed circle and so have a magic
tendency to close her body and cause difficult childbirth. This,
however, is not a matter that concerns anybody else, and so could be of
no interest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1815" href="#xd20e1815"
name="xd20e1815">12</a>]</span>at law. It is taboo for brothers to
defecate near each other, but only they are harmed thereby, and the
matter is consequently not of legal interest.</p>
<p>The breaking of a taboo that concerns the person or possessions of
an individual of another family is a crime. The following instances
will illustrate:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">In nearly all districts<a class="noteref" id=
"n12.2src" href="#n12.2" name="n12.2src">2</a> of Ifugao it is taboo
for persons of other districts<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n12.2">2</a> to pass through a rice field when it is being harvested.
It is also taboo for foreigners to enter a village when that village is
observing its ceremonial idleness, <i>tungul</i>, at the close of
harvest time. One who broke this taboo would be subject to fine. In
case it were believed that the fine could not be collected, he would be
in danger of the lance.</p>
<p>It is taboo to blackguard, to use certain language, and to do
certain things in the presence of one&rsquo;s own kin of the opposite
sex that are of the degrees of kinship within which marriage is
forbidden or in the presence of another and such kindred of his, or to
make any except the most delicately concealed references to matters
connected with sex, sexual intercourse, and reproduction. Even these
delicately concealed references are permissible only in cases of real
necessity. The breaking of this taboo is a serious offense. One who
broke the taboo in the presence of his own female kin would not be
punished except in so far as the contempt of his fellows is a
punishment. In Kiangan, before the establishment of foreign government,
breaking the taboo in the presence of another and his female kin of the
forbidden degrees is said to have been sometimes punished by the lance
(see <a href="#s123">sec. 123</a>).</p>
<p>It is taboo for one who knows of a man&rsquo;s death to ask a
relative of the dead man if the man is dead. The breaking of this taboo
is punishable by fine.</p>
</div>
<p>If asked, Ifugaos say that it is taboo to steal; to burn or destroy
the property of another; to insult, or ruin the good name of another;
to cause the death or injury of another by sorcery or witchcraft; in
short, to commit any of those acts which among most peoples constitute
a crime.</p>
<p>The word <i>taboo</i> as understood among ourselves, and as most
often used among the Ifugaos, denotes a thing rather <i>arbitrarily</i>
forbidden. It seems likely that moral laws&mdash;from which most
criminal laws are an outgrowth&mdash;originate thus: the social
conscience, learning that some act is antisocial, prohibits it (often
in conjunction with religion) or some feature of it, or some
<i>semblance</i> of it, arbitrarily, harshly, and sometimes
unreasonably. Thus the first taboo set forth above has the semblance of
being aimed against interruption in the business or serious occupation
of another, or against his worship. The mere passing near a rice field
when it is being harvested or the mere entrance into a village during
the period of ceremonial idleness are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e1852" href="#xd20e1852" name=
"xd20e1852">13</a>]</span>arbitrarily seized upon as acts constituting
such interruptions. The second taboo arose from the purpose of the
social consciousness to prevent marriage or sexual intercourse between
near kin.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1854src" href="#xd20e1854" name=
"xd20e1854src">3</a> It is most sweeping and unreasonable in its
prohibitions. A third person may make no remark in the presence of kin
of the opposite sex as to the fit of the girl&rsquo;s clothing; as to
her beauty; nor may he refer to her lover, nor play the lover&rsquo;s
harp. Many ordinary things must be called by other than their ordinary
names. Even the aged priests who officiate at a birth feast must refer
in their prayers to the foetus about to be born as &ldquo;the
friend&rdquo; and to the placenta as &ldquo;his blanket.&rdquo; A great
number of things are forbidden in the presence of kindred of opposite
sex that would not shock even the most prudish of our own people. The
third taboo seems to be aimed against the bandying or the taking in
vain of the name of the dead.</p>
<p>It would seem that a primitive society, once it has decided a thing
to be wrong, swings like a pendulum to the very opposite extreme, adds
taboo upon taboo, and hedges with taboo most illogically. With the
ardor of the neophyte, it goes to the other limit, becoming squeamish
in the extreme of all that can in the remotest conception be connected
with the forbidden thing.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1859src" href=
"#xd20e1859" name="xd20e1859src">4</a></p>
<p>Ultimately reason and logic tend to triumph and eliminate the
illogical, impertinent and immaterial taboos, remove the prohibitions
contained in the useful taboos from their pedestal of magic, and set
them upon a firmer base of intelligence, or at least practical
empiricism.</p>
<p>A small part of Ifugao law consists even yet of taboos that are
arbitrary and, except in essence, unreasonable. But the greater part
has advanced far beyond this stage and is on a firm and reasonable
basis of justice. Much of it originated from taboo&mdash;even yet the
taboos are remembered and frequently applied to acts that constitute
crimes among ourselves&mdash;but the immaterial and arbitrary taboos
have been eliminated. Although the Ifugaos say that adultery and theft
and arson are tabooed, nevertheless their attitude of mind is not the
same as that toward things that are <i>merely</i> tabooed. It is the
attitude of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1869" href="#xd20e1869"
name="xd20e1869">14</a>]</span>the human mind toward things that are
prohibited by law and by conscience.</p>
<p id="s2">2. <i>Scope of customary law.</i>&mdash;The customary law
embraces that which pertains to property, inheritance, water rights,
and to a great extent, family law and procedure. There is a certain
amount of variation in customs and taboos throughout Ifugao land. This
accounts to a certain extent, perhaps, for the reserved behavior of
visitors to a district distant from their own. Visitors are afraid of
unwittingly breaking some taboo. In general, however, it may be said
that laws are very nearly uniform throughout the Ifugao country.</p>
<p id="s3">3. <i>Connection of law and religion.</i>&mdash;Religion and
law appear conjointly in (<i>a</i>) transferals of family property;
(<i>b</i>) ordeals; (<i>c</i>) certain taboos; (<i>d</i>) payments of
the larger fines; (<i>e</i>) peace-making. The Ifugaos state that a
large part of their customary law and procedure was given them by
Lidum, their great teacher, a deity of the Skyworld, and an uncle of
their hero-ancestor, Balitok.</p>
<p id="s4">4. <i>General principles of the Ifugao legal
system.</i>&mdash;<i>Its personal character.</i> Society does not
punish injuries to itself except as the censure of public opinion is a
punishment. This follows naturally from the fact that there is no
organized society. It is only when an injury committed by a person or
family falls on another person or family that the injury is punished
formally.</p>
<p><i>Collective responsibility.</i> Not only the individual who
commits an act but his kin, in proportion to the nearness of their
kinship, are responsible for the act. Their responsibility is slightly
less than his. This applies not only to crimes but to debts and civil
injuries.</p>
<p><i>Collective procedure.</i> Legal procedure is by and between
families; therefore a family should be &ldquo;strong to demand and
strong to resist demands.&rdquo; <i>A member of an Ifugao family
assists in the punishment of offenders against any other member of his
family, and resists the punishment of members of his family by other
families.</i> A number of circumstances affect the ardor with which he
enters into procedures in which a relative is concerned and the extent
to which he will go into them. Among these are: (<i>a</i>) the nearness
or remoteness of his relationship to the relative concerned in the
action; (<i>b</i>) relationship to the other principal in the action;
(<i>c</i>) the loyalty to the family group of the relative principally
concerned in the procedure and the extent to which this relative
discharges his duty to it; (<i>d</i>) evidence in the case bearing on
the correctness of the relative&rsquo;s position in the controversy.

<p><i>A corollary of the above principle.</i> Since legal procedure is
between families, and never between individuals, nor between a family
and an individual, crimes of brother or sister against brother or
sister go unpunished. The family of the two individuals is identical.
<i>A family cannot proceed against itself.</i> But in the case of
incest between a father and a daughter the father might be punished by
the girl&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s family on the ground that he had
committed a crime against a member of that family. It is true that just
as great an injury would have been committed against the family of the
father, since the relationship of the daughter to that family is the
same as to her mother&rsquo;s family. But the father, the perpetrator
of the crime, being a nearer relative of his own family than his
daughter, his family certainly would not take active steps against him.
Were the crime a less disgraceful one, the father&rsquo;s kin would
probably contest his penalty.</p>
<p><i>The family unity must at all hazards be preserved.</i> Clemency
is shown the remoter kin in order to secure their loyalty to the family
group. A large unified family group is in the ideal position of being
&ldquo;strong to demand and strong to resist demands.&rdquo; The family
is the only thing of the nature of an organization that the Ifugao has,
and he cherishes it accordingly.</p>
<p><i>Collective recipiency of punishment.</i> Just as the family group
is collectively responsible for the delinquencies of its members, but
in less degree than the delinquent himself, so may punishment be meted
out to individuals of the group other than the actual culprit, although
naturally it is preferred to punish the actual culprit; and so may
debts or indemnities be collected from them. But only those individuals
that are of the nearest degree of kinship may be held responsible;
cousins may not <i>legally</i> be punished if there be brothers or
sisters.</p>
<p><i>Ifugao law is very personal in its character.</i> For the
different classes of society there are in the Mampolia-Kababuyan area
five grades of fines in punishment of a given crime, four in the
Hapao-Hunduan area, and three in the Kiangan area.</p>
<p><i>Might is right</i> to a very great extent in the administration
of justice. For a given crime, one family, on account of superior war
footing, or superior diplomacy, or on account of being better bluffers,
will be able to exact much more severe penalties than another.
Especially is Ifugao administration of justice likely to be unfair when
persons of different classes are parties to a controversy. I doubt very
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1957" href="#xd20e1957" name=
"xd20e1957">16</a>]</span>much, however, whether this characteristic of
Ifugao administration of justice be more pronounced than it is in our
own.</p>
<p id="s5">5. <i>Stage of development of Ifugao law.</i>&mdash;Reasons
have already been given for believing the Ifugao&rsquo;s culture to be
very old. His legal system must also be old. Yet it is in the first
stage of the development of law. It is, however, an example of a very
well developed first-stage legal system. It ranks fairly with Hebrew
law, or even with the Mohammedan law of a century ago. R. R. Cherry in
his lectures on the <i>Growth of Criminal Law in Ancient
Communities</i> demonstrates these stages of legal development: First,
a stage of simple retaliation&mdash;&ldquo;an eve for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth, a life for a life.&rdquo; Second, a stage in which
vengeance may be bought off &ldquo;either by the individual who has
inflicted the injury or by his tribe.&rdquo; Third, a stage in which
the tribe or its chiefs or elders intervene to fix penalty-payments and
to pronounce sentence of outlawry on those who refuse to pay proper
fines. Fourth, a stage in which offenses come to be clearly recognized
as crimes against the peace and welfare of the king or the state.</p>
<p>No Ifugao would dream of taking a payment for the deliberate or
intentional murder of a kinsman. He would be universally condemned if
he did so. However, he would usually accept a payment for an accidental
taking of life. There is still, however, an element of doubt as to
whether even in such a case payment would be accepted. For nearly all
other offenses payments are accepted in extenuation. Ifugao law, then,
may be said to be in the latter part of the first stage of legal
development. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e1969" href="#xd20e1969"

present population of the Philippine Islands is about 10,000,000.
Notwithstanding, there are vast stretches of unoccupied lowlands. At
the coming of the Spaniards the population of the tribes that now are
Christian has been estimated at 500,000. These second Malay immigrants
undoubtedly gained the principal part of their livelihood from
agriculture, for which they needed little land. Why, then, is it
hypothesized that any immigration <i>drove</i> another to the
mountains? My own belief is that the first immigrants went to the
mountains of their own volition for the reason that they had been a
mountain people and a terrace-building people in their former home.</p>

doubting if so sweeping an assertion as this can be true, especially
when we consider that even in its most primitive phases human life is
exceedingly complex and intricate, I invite attention to the fact that
magic is such an all-embracing thing in primitive society, and is so
closely connected with matters of morality and public policy, that
there is nothing in this paragraph that can offend even those who hold
that the field of taboo is one wholly of magic prohibitions.</p>

<p id="s6" class="first">6. <i>Polygamy.</i>&mdash;The extent to which
personality affects what an Ifugao may or may not do without being
considered an offender is illustrated in the matter of polygamy. Any
Ifugao, except one of the most powerful, who might try to take a plural
wife would only bring upon himself heavy punishment&mdash;punishment
that would be administered by the kin of the first wife. But men who
are very wealthy and who are also gifted with a considerable amount of
force of character sometimes take a second or even a third wife, and
compel the kin of the first wife to recognize her and her children. In
other words, they <i>make</i> polygamy legal for themselves. The first
wife is of higher class than succeeding wives. Her children have
inheritance rights to all the property their father had at the time of
the taking of the plural wife. The following is a typical instance of
the taking of a plural wife:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Guade of Maggok, an extremely wealthy man, after
marrying and having a number of children by his first wife, began
habitually to have illicit intercourse with another woman. The kin of
the first wife demanded a heavy indemnity. Such was their <i>bungot</i>
(ferocity) that they succeeded in making Guade think that he was in
imminent peril of losing his life, and in collecting double the amount
usual in such cases. But having paid the fine, Guade rallied to his
support all his kin and kept up the relations with the woman, taking
her as a second wife. Nor did the kin of the first wife attempt to
prohibit this, well knowing that they had gone far enough. The second
wife is recognized, and her children are recognized, as legitimate.
Guade informed me recently that he was thinking seriously of taking a
third. Guade is admired and envied by every one in the community
apparently; whereas a man of less force would be condemned by public
opinion.</p>
</div>
<p>When a plural wife is taken a heavy payment must be made the first
wife and her kin. This may amount to about 500 pesos.</p>
<p id="s7">7. <i>Nature of marriage.</i>&mdash;Marriage among the
Ifugaos is a civil contract of <i>undefined</i> duration. It may last a
month, a year, a decade, or until the death of one of the parties to
it. <i>It has no essential connection with the tribal religion.</i>
True, at almost every step in its consummation the family ancestral
spirits and the other deities are besought to bless the union in a
material way in the matter of children and wealth and by giving the two
parties long life. But this is a matter of self interest, and not of
hallowing or consecrating the union. Should the omens be bad, the two
people do not marry because they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e2004" href="#xd20e2004" name="xd20e2004">18</a>]</span>are afraid
that in the shape of sickness or death or childlessness, ill fortune
may overtake them if they do so. And even after the marriage has been
fully consummated should it happen that at any one of three certain
feasts performed by the parents of the couple during the year in
connection with their rice crop, the omen of the bile sac<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2006src" href="#xd20e2006" name="xd20e2006src">1</a>
should promise ill, the marriage is dissolved. No promises are made by
the contracting parties to each other or to anybody else. Nor do the
contracting parties take any part in any religious ceremonials or in
any marriage ceremonials of any kind. Marriage may be terminated at any
time by mutual agreement. But that marriage is considered a contract is
shown by the fact that if either party terminates the marriage against
the will of the other the injured party has the right to assess and
collect damages.</p>
<p>The theory that marriage should be permanent in order to provide the
better for the training and rearing of children has no legal
embodiment.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2011src" href="#xd20e2011" name=
"xd20e2011src">2</a> It is, however, established by custom that in case
of divorce a property settlement according to the wealth of the family
must be made on the children.</p>
<p id="s8">8. <i>Eligibility to marriage.</i>&mdash;Any person of any
age may marry. The consent of the parents is not necessary. But there
is taboo on the marriage of cousins within the third degree. This taboo
may be rendered inoperative, except in the case of full cousins, by an
exchange of animals ranging from two pigs in the case of the nearer
relationships to one small pig or a chicken in the case of the remoter.
The girl&rsquo;s kin in all cases receive the more valuable animals in
this exchange. But the marriage of first cousins is absolutely tabooed
and never occurs. It is said that children are sometimes coerced into
marriage against their will; but I have heard of only one case in which
physical force was used, and even in this case the attempt ended in
failure.</p>
<p id="s9">9. <i>The two ways in which marriage may be brought
about.</i>&mdash;Those children that will inherit a great deal of
property are married <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2027" href=
"#xd20e2027" name="xd20e2027">19</a>]</span>usually, but by no means
always, by a <i>contract</i><a class="noteref" id="xd20e2031src" href=
"#xd20e2031" name="xd20e2031src">3</a> marriage; those who will inherit
no property, or but a small amount, and those who, married by the
preceding method, have lost their spouses, or who on reaching a maturer
age, do not find themselves compatible with their spouses, and
consequently remarry, are married by a <i>trial</i> marriage. However,
it should be said that even a <i>contract</i> marriage is a trial
marriage to a great degree. In fact, one inclined to be prudent in his
speech would never pronounce an Ifugao marriage a permanent one until
the death of one of the parties to it.</p>
<p>The trial marriage is merely a primitive sexual mating in the
dormitories of the unmarried. It might be called a courtship, it being
understood that, except in its very incipiency, Ifugao courtship
postulates an accompaniment of sexual intercourse. It is very
reprehensible, but not punishable, for a girl to enter into two such
unions contemporaneously. The moral code is hardly so strict with
respect to the male.</p>
<p>In case the two individuals are satisfied with each other, that is,
in case they find themselves compatible, and nearly always in case the
girl becomes pregnant and the youth has no reason for misgivings as to
the parentage of the child, the youth, after consultation with his
parents, sends a distant relative or friend, <i>who is not related to
the girl</i>, with betels for a ceremonial conference in which the hand
of the girl is asked in marriage. Generally it requires two or more
trial marriages to select for a person his <i>more permanent</i>
mate.</p>
<p id="s10">10. <i>Contract marriage.</i>&mdash;The contract marriage
is usually arranged for, and its first ceremonies at least performed
while the children are quite small. Its purpose is to guard against the
commission of such a folly on the part of the child who will be wealthy
as marriage to a less wealthy spouse. The danger is that such a child,
sleeping in the common dormitory, will give way to the ardor of youth
and temporarily mate with one below him in station, and that the union
so begun prove permanent.</p>
<p>As a rule the couple married by a contract marriage while yet
children are elevated by the <i>uyauwe</i> feast to the category of the
<i>kadangyang</i> (upper class). The <i>uyauwe</i> feast is not an
essential part of the marriage ceremonials, but is an addition to
them.</p>
<p>The following is the history of a typical marriage of this kind:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2069" href="#xd20e2069" name=
"xd20e2069">20</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Dulinayan of Ambabag, when his son was about two years
old, sent a go-between to Likyayu, also of Ambabag, whose daughter was
somewhat younger than Dulinayan&rsquo;s son, with betels for a
ceremonial conference looking toward a marriage between the two
children. He stated that he would contract to give his son his fields
at Takadang, and wished to know what fields Likyayu would give his
daughter. The go-between returned, stating that Likyayu&rsquo;s people
did not consider Dulinayan&rsquo;s fields at Takadang seriously, and
asked that he assign the boy his fields at Banggo and Dayukong in order
that they might consider the union of their daughter with his son. The
go-between stated that Likyayu was considering bestowing on his
daughter his field at Takadang.</p>
<p>Dulinayan returned the go-between to state that he did not take as
being very serious Likyayu&rsquo;s statement that he intended to give
his daughter only the field at Takadang. He made the proposal that
Likyayu add to the field at Takadang the one at Danok, and stated that
if Likyayu would do so he would give his son the fields at Banggo and
Dayukong, as Likyayu suggested. Likyayu accepted this proposal.</p>
<p>After two or three more conferences, it was agreed that Dulinayan
was to assign his son the following movable family property: 1
rice-wine jar, 1 <i>gansa</i>, 1 gold ornament. Likyayu was to assign
his daughter 1 rice-wine jar, 1 gold ornament, and 1 <i>pango</i>
(string of ancient beads). Besides the above, Likyayu would give, at
the proper time, a house for the young couple. Each of the two men
would present his child a granary.</p>
<p>The above agreement made, Dulinayan sent a pig called <i>tokop di
mommon</i> and a pig called <i>imbango</i>. These pigs were sacrificed
by Likyayu and his kin. The omens of the bile sacs promised well.
Likyayu returned 1 <i>natauwinan</i> (4 spears), as the <i>mangdad</i>
of the <i>imbango</i>.</p>
<p>About three years elapsed before anything further was done toward
the completion of the marriage. During this period Dulinayan on behalf
of his son furnished Likyayu&rsquo;s household with what firewood was
needed and kept his granaries in repair. Whenever his son&rsquo;s
betrothed fell ill, or whenever her parents or grandparents fell ill,
Dulinayan furnished a pig for sacrifice. And whenever Dulinayan&rsquo;s
son or his son&rsquo;s parents or grandparents fell ill Likyayu
furnished a pig. Likewise when one of the direct ascendants of either
of the young couple died the other family furnished a pig for the
funeral and a death blanket as one of the burial robes.</p>
<p>In the year 1912&mdash;that is, three years after the contract was
made&mdash;Dulinayan sent a man to propose an <i>uyauwe</i>. Each
family performed a granary feast to determine whether the time was
propitious. The omens being good, each family notified the other of the
fact. Dulinayan then sent a large pig as the <i>hingot</i>.
Likyayu&rsquo;s people returned a small pig as <i>hulul di hingot</i>.
Then Dulinayan furnished a large pig for the <i>bubun</i>, and the two
families met for the first time during the period of the negotiations
and sacrificed and prayed together.</p>
<p>A short time afterward the children were made <i>kadangyang</i> by
the giving of an <i>uyauwe</i> feast. At this feast Dulinayan gave
<i>hakba</i> (marriage presents) to Likyayu and his kin.</p>
</div>
<p>In a contract marriage there is always an assignment to the children
of the property that they will inherit. The amount of property settled
upon either of them is equal or very nearly equal to that settled on
the other. Nor may the parent of one of the children sell any of this
property except for the purpose of providing animals <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2130" href="#xd20e2130" name=
"xd20e2130">21</a>]</span>for sacrifice in case of the illness or death
of the child or one of his direct ascendants, or in case of the illness
or death of the child&rsquo;s betrothed, or one of his direct
ascendants (see <a href="#s13">sec. 13</a>).</p>
<p id="s11">11. <i>Marriage ceremonials.</i>&mdash;The following are
the steps taken to consummate a typical marriage in the Kiangan-Maggok
area:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The boy&rsquo;s kin send the girl&rsquo;s kin a pig. This
pig is sacrificed by the girl&rsquo;s kin. The omen of the bile sac is
consulted. The pig is eaten. This feast is called <i>mommon</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The boy&rsquo;s kin send another pig to the girl&rsquo;s
kin. The girl&rsquo;s kin sacrifice this pig. The omen of the bile sac
is consulted. This feast is called <i>imbango</i>.</p>
<p>A non-essential part of the ceremonials, but an important matter in
some contingencies, is the return by the girl&rsquo;s kin of a gift to
the boy&rsquo;s kin in exchange of the pig sent for this feast. This
return gift is called <i>mangdad</i>. Its effect is to nullify any
right on the part of the boy&rsquo;s kin to demand a repayment of the
pig sent for this ceremony in case the marriage should for any reason
whatever fail to be effected. Even though the failure to complete or
effect the marriage be the girl&rsquo;s fault, if the <i>mangdad</i>
has been sent, the boy&rsquo;s kin have no right to ask a return of the
<i>imbango</i>. The return gift is of much less value than that made by
the boy&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The boy&rsquo;s kin send the girl&rsquo;s kin a pig,
which pig is sacrificed by the girl&rsquo;s kin. The omen of the bile
sac is consulted. This feast is called <i>hingot</i>.</p>
<p>A non-essential part of the ceremonials, but one important in the
same way as in the preceding ceremony, is the return by the
girl&rsquo;s kin of a small pig, called the <i>hulul di hingot</i>
(exchange of the <i>hingot</i>).</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The kin of both the contracting principals meet at the
girl&rsquo;s house and sacrifice a large pig furnished by the
boy&rsquo;s kin. This feast is called <i>bubun</i>, and has for its
especial purpose to obtain from the gods of animal fertility long life,
health, and many children for the young couple. It is attended by a
giving of gifts by the kin of the boy to the kin of the girl, except
that in the case of a contract marriage between <i>kadangyang</i> (the
upper class) the giving of these gifts is often deferred till the
<i>uyauwe</i> ceremony, which, while not part of the marriage
ceremonials, often follows immediately after them.</p>
<p>The programme of marriage ceremonials among the northern Ifugao is
somewhat different.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Same as (<i>a</i>) above. This ceremonial is omitted
except in marriages between the wealthy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e2207" href="#xd20e2207" name="xd20e2207">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The boy&rsquo;s kin sacrifice a pig at his home, sending
half of it, if the omen of the bile sac promises well, to the kin of
the girl in a back basket, called <i>bango</i>, whence originates the
term <i>imbango</i>, meaning &ldquo;carried in a
<i>bango</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The boy&rsquo;s kin take a pig to the girl&rsquo;s home.
The girl&rsquo;s kin furnish another and smaller pig. Both families
participate in a religious feast. This feast is called <i>tanig</i>,
and seems to include both the <i>bubun</i> and the <i>hingot</i> of the
Kiangan people.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Ceremonial idleness for the boy and the girl is required
during a period of five days. On the third day the couple go to one of
their fields, it being taboo for either of them to stumble on the way.
The trip is in one respect somewhat like the time-honored cutting of
the cakes in one of our own marriage feasts to secure a prognostication
as to which of the two spouses will die first. Stumbling on the part of
one of the couple, however, would indicate that that one would die not
only first but soon, and would probably lead to a refusal on his or her
part to go ahead with the marriage.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2242src"
href="#xd20e2242" name="xd20e2242src">4</a> Arrived at the field, the
girl weeds a part of it, and the boy gathers some wood from a near-by
forest. Then they go home, the boy carrying the bundle of wood.</p>
<p>In case a bad omen of the bile sac is encountered in any of these
ceremonies, the marriage is not proceeded with, since the belief is
that misfortune would surely attend it.</p>
<p>In the case of the poor, some of the above ceremonies may be
omitted; or chickens or smaller pigs may be substituted for any or all
the pigs. The above programme is simply that which is to be followed
out if the groom be financially able to do the &ldquo;right
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In case the spouses are related, two pigs&mdash;a male and a
female&mdash;are sacrificed, and the ceremony called <i>ponga</i> is
performed. The larger pig is furnished by the boy. The nearer the
kinship the larger the pigs necessary for this ceremony.</p>
<p>At no time are any vows or promises made by the principals. At no
time, except in the fourth ceremony among the Northern Ifugao, do the
principals have any active part in the ceremonies. Indeed, they may not
eat the meat of the pigs or chickens killed at their own wedding, for
it is taboo to them.</p>
<p id="s12">12. <i>Gifts to the kin of the bride: hakba.</i>&mdash;In
the Kiangan area, but in no other, expensive gifts are made to the kin
of the bride. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2264" href=
"#xd20e2264" name="xd20e2264">23</a>]</span>These gifts are called
<i>hakba</i>. Only in the case of the very poorest are gifts foregone.
The gifts are distributed to the girl&rsquo;s kin, the nearer kin
receiving the more valuable and the remote kin the less valuable
articles. But the elder of a line of cousins by a single uncle, for
example, receives a more valuable present, the next in age a less
valuable one, the next in age a still less valuable one, and so on, the
youngest getting nothing if he have many brothers and sisters. No
distinction is made between male and female kin. The gifts may range
from two death blankets, worth 16 pesos, to a spearhead worth 0.20
peso.</p>
<p>Except in the case of the poverty-stricken, there is nothing for it
but to pay these presents. If they be not forthcoming, the kin of the
woman seize the pig provided for the <i>bubun</i> ceremony, carry it
home and guard it well till such time as the groom comes forward with
the <i>hakba</i> gifts, when they return it for the ceremonial.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the <i>hakba</i> given by Dulinayan of
Ambabag to Likyayu&rsquo;s family of the same village on the occasion
of the marriage of the son of the former to the daughter of the
latter.</p>

<p>A member of the lower middle class would spend about 92 pesos, and a
member of the poorer class would spend about 36 pesos.</p>
<p id="s13">13. <i>Obligations incurred by those who enter into a
marriage contract.</i>&mdash;First. The initial ceremony, the
<i>mommon</i>, puts upon the principals in a marriage contract the
obligation to abstain from sexual relations with any other persons.
Sexual intercourse with any other person constitutes the crime of
adultery. The degree of guilt for lapses in this respect depends on the
progress that has been made toward the completion of the marriage, the
culpability growing progressively with the performance of each
succeeding marriage ceremonial.</p>
<p>Second. The obligation rests on the boy and his kin to furnish the
immediate family of the girl with firewood from the time at which the
first ceremony is performed until the young couple separate to live in
a house by themselves.</p>
<p>Third. For the same period of time as that embraced in the preceding
paragraph, the obligation rests on the boy and his kin to keep the
granaries of the family of the girl in repair, and to reroof them
whenever needful.</p>
<p>Fourth. Each family helps the other in all that pertains to rice
culture throughout the first year following the <i>bubun</i> ceremony.
Each family furnishes the other with the pig necessary for the
sacrifice at each of the three important rice-culture feasts: the
<i>kulpe</i> (growth feast), the <i>kolating</i> (harvest feast), and
the <i>tuldag</i> (granary feast).</p>
<p>Fifth. From the time at which the first ceremony is performed until
the dissolution of the marriage, it is the duty of either spouse to
furnish a pig to the other in the event of the sickness of the other or
of any of his or her lineal ascendants.</p>
<p>Sixth. For the same period as that embraced in the preceding
paragraph it is the duty of either spouse to furnish the other in the
event of the death of any of the lineal ascendants of the other, a pig
and a death blanket.</p>
<p>If the spouses be too young to attend to any of their respective
obligations to each other or to the families concerned, it is the duty
of their parents to attend to the discharge of the obligations.</p>
<p>The non-fulfilment or the non-discharge of any of the above
obligations is sufficient cause for a demand for a divorce on the part
of the injured spouse. The Ifugao does not consider it to be the duty
of any person to leave his father and mother and cling to his wife
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2443" href="#xd20e2443" name=
"xd20e2443">25</a>]</span>or husband. Rather does he consider the
opposite to be the duty. A good many marriages are undone between
children because of the non-fulfilment of one of these obligations on
the part of one of the families involved. It matters not that the
spouse be so young as to be of necessity innocent.</p>
<p>The husband has a right to have sexual intercourse with his wife. If
she does not accede to his desires, he has the right to force her <i>if
he can</i>, but he must not strike or injure her in his attempt. If he
cannot force her, he may demand a divorce. Ordinarily no man can have
sexual intercourse with an Ifugao woman possessed of her reason and of
normal strength, against that woman&rsquo;s will.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Bugan of Baay, a very pretty girl, was married by her
parents against her will to Pingkihan of Baay, a very rich but,
unfortunately, a darkish and very ugly man. The marriage proceeded as
far as the <i>hingot</i>, when it was thought wise by Pingkihan and the
part of justice by the kin of the girl that the girl give her body
before the proceeding went further. Pingkihan made many futile attempts
to attain this purpose, but all in vain. Finally he despaired. The
girl&rsquo;s father, however, told him to come to his house one night.
Pingkihan did so. An uncle of the girl caught her, and held her.
Pingkihan tried in vain to have sexual intercourse with her. The
girl&rsquo;s resistance made the thing impossible. The marriage
ceremonies were carried no further.</p>
</div>
<p>It cannot be too strongly emphasized that husband and wife <i>are
never united into one family</i>. <i>They are merely allies.</i> The
ties that bind each to his own family are much stronger than the ties
that bind them together. An Ifugao explained this to me by putting his
hands parallel, the forefingers together. The forefingers represent the
two spouses; the hands the two families. Should the two families
separate, should they withdraw from amity and agreement, the two
spouses, the forefingers, of necessity withdraw, because they are
attached to different hands.</p>
<p>Each succeeding feast in the consummation of the marriage carries
with it an added degree of obligation and of alliance; and an added
degree of culpability in cases of failure to comply with the marital
obligations and in cases of crimes against the marriage.</p>
<p id="s14">14. <i>The binawit relation.</i>&mdash;Oftentimes when the
spouses are children and live in different villages, as soon as they
are of sufficient age to have some feeling for each other&mdash;at ten
or more years, for instance&mdash;one of them goes to the house of the
other. Usually the two espoused children live for a time at the house
of the parents of the one, and then for a time at the house of the
parents of the other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2473" href=
"#xd20e2473" name="xd20e2473">26</a>]</span>A child living thus at the
house of his parents-in-law is called <i>binawit</i>. This matter is
purely optional with the children, and is a matter of convenience to
them.</p>
<p>The father of the girl has, however, a mean advantage, which he
sometimes, though rarely, uses. If, for example, his son-in-law be a
good worker, he counsels his daughter not to go to the house of her
father-in-law, in order that she may hold her husband in his house to
the end that the family profit by his labor. And even though the couple
may have arrived at the age of separating from their elders and living
in a house to themselves, the father of the girl refuses to give her
her rice fields, putting the boy off from season to season with
&ldquo;Wait till next harvest&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wait till next spading
time.&rdquo; It is true that the boy has in such conduct on the part of
his father-in-law sufficient cause to justify him in divorcing the
girl; but if he divorces her, he loses all that he has spent for
sacrifices and <i>hakba</i> gifts!</p>
<p id="s15">15. <i>Property rights acquired by
marriage.</i>&mdash;Neither spouse acquires any interest in the
property that the other possesses at the time of the marriage. Each
has, however, the right to veto the sale or transfer of the family
property<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2488src" href="#xd20e2488" name=
"xd20e2488src">5</a> of the other except where legal and sufficient
reasons exist for such transfer. These legal and sufficient reasons are
the necessity of selling the field: (<i>a</i>) to provide the necessary
things for a funeral feast for ascendants or kinfolk; (<i>b</i>) to pay
rightful debts; (<i>c</i>) to pay fines or indemnities; (<i>d</i>) to
provide things necessary for feasts and sacrifices which are considered
essential&mdash;a very liberal interpretation being placed upon the
word &ldquo;essential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should a man sell a field for a light or trivial cause without the
permission of his wife, the validity of the transfer would not be
effected by the fact of the non-consent of the wife. But the wife would
have recourse for damages from her husband, and might demand:
(<i>a</i>) twice the price received for the field as a settlement on
their children; (<i>b</i>) a divorce; (<i>c</i>) or both. The right of
each spouse to veto the sale of the other&rsquo;s property is equal and
the same. This right is based principally or perhaps wholly on the
ground that each spouse is the guardian of the interest of the children
of the union, born or unborn.</p>
<p>The spouses have a joint right in all property acquired after
marriage as the result of their joint labors; that is to say, any
property whatever obtained except (<i>a</i>) by the sale of the fields
of the one and the repurchase of other fields with the proceeds;
(<i>b</i>) as the result of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2526"
href="#xd20e2526" name="xd20e2526">27</a>]</span>a fine or indemnity
assessed by the family of one against some person for injury done a
member of that family; (<i>c</i>) ceremonial gifts such as the
<i>hakba</i> and <i>habalag</i>; (<i>d</i>) inheritance.</p>

<h3 class="main">Remarriage of the Widowed</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s16" class="first">16. <i>The gibu payment to terminate
marriage.</i>&mdash;Even death itself does not terminate an Ifugao
marriage. It terminates neither the obligation of the widowed to the
soul of the dead spouse nor the compact of alliance between the two
families involved. This obligation and this compact may be terminated
only by the payment known as the <i lang="ifu">gibu</i>.</p>
<p>The word <i lang="ifu">gibu</i> means literally
&ldquo;finish&rdquo;. In its narrowest and probably original sense it
may have meant a payment to terminate all the relations and obligations
growing out of a marriage. There is another explanation. From the day
of the death of a spouse till the third day after the interment (when
the <i lang="ifu">binokbok</i> ceremony is performed), the kin of the
deceased and the kin of the surviving spouse are on terms of
theoretical enmity. They observe with reference to each other all the
taboos that are observed toward enemies. This practice may have arisen
from a former belief&mdash;a belief that is current among many
primitive peoples today&mdash;that every death is due to sorcery or
witchcraft. Whom so naturally blamed as the surviving spouse or his
kin? If this be the explanation, then the <i>gibu</i> originated as an
indemnity paid for the life of the deceased.</p>
<p>In the present day, the <i lang="ifu">gibu</i> in a broader sense
applies to all fines and indemnities paid in connection with the abuse
or termination of a marriage.</p>
<p>A remarriage may not properly be effected by the widowed until he
has paid the kin of the dead spouse the <i lang="ifu">gibu &rsquo;n di
nate</i> (<i lang="ifu">gibu</i> of the <i>dead</i>), or the
<i>datok</i>, as it is specifically called. Failure on the part of the
widowed to make this payment would lead to a seizure of his property or
a lance throwing. In the Kiangan area this payment is not nearly so
high as in other parts of Ifugao land, and for the reason that in the
former area large payments are made to the kin of the woman in the
<i lang="ifu">hakba</i> gifts at the beginning of the marriage. In
Benaue and other areas of Ifugao the payments are about five times the
amounts shown in the subjoined table.</p>
<p>The following is the <i lang="ifu">datok</i> payment of the Kiangan
area: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e2590" href="#xd20e2590" name=

<p>It is considered an insult to the deceased and his kin for a widowed
person to remarry within a year from the death of his spouse. In such
an event, a larger <i lang="ifu">gibu</i> is demanded by the kin of the
dead spouse. Should the spouses have had no children, double the amount
usual is demanded as the <i lang="ifu">datok</i>.</p>
<p>If the widowed remarries without having first formally notified the
kin of his dead spouse of his intention, or if he scandalously has
sexual intercourse, he commits adultery according to Ifugao law, and
must pay the <i lang="ifu">gibu luktap</i> (see <a href="#s75">sec.
75</a>, <a href="#s94">94</a>). As a matter of fact, I do not believe
that this law is often enforced. The Ifugaos say that it was nearly
always enforced before the establishment of foreign government.</p>
<p>If the widowed be a woman, both she and the man with whom she
contracts a second marriage are responsible for the <i lang=
"ifu">gibu</i> payment. The payment as a matter of practice is always
made by the man who marries her; but it is said that, should her second
husband for any reason fail to pay, the widow would be held for the
payment.</p>
<p>In the event of the birth of a bastard child to a surviving spouse,
the <i lang="ifu">gibu</i> must be paid.</p>
<p>The following is an instance of the non-payment of this indemnity,
and the <i>sequelae</i>:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Piniliu of Longa married the wife of Butlong, a
deceased kinsman of Timbuluy, also of Longa. Piniliu did not come
forward with the usual <i lang="ifu">datok</i> payment, notwithstanding
the fact that it was repeatedly demanded of him.</p>
<p>Finally Piniliu went to Nueva Viscaya, and there bought a carabao.
Timbuluy gathered his kin and met Piniliu when he was bringing back the
carabao. About two miles before they reached their home village
Timbuluy and his kin seized the animal, hamstringing and slaughtering
it before Piniliu&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The act of Timbuluy may very safely be said to have been justified
by Ifugao custom, and so to have been legal.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>gibu</i> is smaller if the second spouse taken be a kinsman
or kinswoman of the first.</p>
<p>If the living spouse should not have furnished the animal required
of him (see <a href="#s13">sec. 13</a>) and a death blanket for the
funeral of the dead spouse, the value of these things is added to the
amount of the <i lang="ifu">gibu</i>.<a class="noteref" id=

which gave even a single ill omen in any of these cases. It is not
permitted to provide another pig and consult the omen again in any of

<p id="s21">21. <i>The hudhud, or payment for mental
anguish.</i>&mdash;This is the fine or indemnity assessed in cases of
divorce at the instance of one of the parties, when uncomplicated by
improper sexual relations, on the ground of mental anguish, <i lang=
"ifu">hakit di nemnem</i>, literally, &ldquo;hurt of the mind.&rdquo;
In general it may be said to be assessed against that spouse who has
made necessary the dissolution of the marriage, whether or not he be
the one who takes the initiative in effecting the divorce. Should the
divorce be effected on account of sexual crime of one of the spouses,
the <i>greater the injury the more severely the crime</i> is punished.
The <i lang="ifu">hudhud</i> is a small fine, but its payment is said
effectually to banish the mental anguish. The dignity and
self-importance of the Malay are of unusual proportions in comparison
with his other feelings and emotions. In Kiangan district there are
three grades of the <i lang="ifu">hudhud</i>: one for the <i lang=

<p>In case of a change of mind leading to an unwillingness to proceed
with the marriage, the following additional data are pertinent: Should
the girl refuse to proceed with the marriage after the performance of
the <i lang="ifu">mommon</i> ceremonial and before the performance of
the <i lang="ifu">imbango</i> ceremonial, she pays simply the <i lang=
"ifu">hudhud</i>; should she refuse after the <i lang=
"ifu">imbango</i>, she pays the <i lang="ifu">hudhud</i>, and, unless
her kin have given the boy&rsquo;s kin the <i lang="ifu">mangdad di
imbango</i>, she pays back the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3423"
href="#xd20e3423" name="xd20e3423">33</a>]</span>pig given her family
by the boy&rsquo;s family for the <i lang="ifu">imbango</i> ceremonial.
The same is true, <i lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, should she refuse
to proceed after the <i lang="ifu">hingot</i> ceremony. The boy may
refuse to proceed with the marriage after the <i lang="ifu">mommon</i>
and before the <i lang="ifu">imbango</i> without liability to damages;
should he refuse after the <i lang="ifu">imbango</i>, he must pay the
<i lang="ifu">hudhud</i>.</p>
<p id="s22">22. <i>Divorce ceremonies.</i>&mdash;It is only when
divorce is by mutual agreement that divorce is attended by any
ceremonies. The ceremonies consist of a <i lang="ifu">honga</i>, or
general welfare feast, not greatly different in spirit from the
ceremonials by which the couple were married. In other cases, the
couple have separated prior to the formal divorce or have such ill
feeling toward each other that concerted action is impossible.</p>
<p id="s23">23. <i>Property settlements in case of
divorce.</i>&mdash;(1) When there are no children: Each spouse takes
the property that he brought to the marriage, together with any
property received since by inheritance, or solely by virtue of his
relationship to his own family.</p>
<p>The remaining property, that is, family property such as rice
fields, gold ornaments, <i>gansas</i>, etc., and personal property such
as food stores, house furnishings, implements, domestic animals, and
also liabilities that rightfully bear equally on both spouses are
apportioned by two umpires, <i lang="ifu">monhangdad</i>, one chosen by
each spouse. These persons make an equitable division, taking as their
fee any odd articles of personal property. Thus if there be three
<i>bolos</i>, they take one; if there be a chicken &ldquo;left
over,&rdquo; they take it. They may not carry this appropriation to
themselves too far, however.</p>
<p>(2) When there are children of the union: The woman has the
<i>right</i> to the children, and nearly always exercises it. In some
cases, when the mother has no rice fields and the father does have rice
fields, and when the children are large enough not to need a
mother&rsquo;s care, by special agreement the father takes one or more
of the children.</p>
<p>Whoever takes the children takes possession of the property that
belongs to them. Usually the woman takes all the children and manages
the husband&rsquo;s family property that has been allotted them.</p>
<p>All the property of both the spouses must be assigned to their
children at the time of the divorce (except the personal property). The
one who takes a child takes also the property of that child and tills
it. He may not dispose of it except for the purpose of meeting
legitimate obligations against it. Should the child die, its brothers
and sisters inherit the property. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Dependents in Relation to Family Law</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s24" class="first">24. <i>Adopted children.</i>&mdash;An adopted
child is termed <i lang="ifu">inagamid</i>, that is, &ldquo;taken to
one&rsquo;s self&rdquo;; or it may be termed <i lang=
"ifu">na-imbalbalayen</i>, &ldquo;made one&rsquo;s child.&rdquo; The
word <i lang="ifu">inagamid</i> is also used to denote a slave taken
into a household.</p>
<p>Adoptions are rather rare; for the reason, I suspect, that it is
only the propertied class who make them, and that persons of this
class, being well nurtured, usually have children of their own. Usually
the child adopted is the son or daughter of a brother or sister, and so
is really, according to the Ifugao mode of reckoning kinship, the son
or daughter of the adopter. Which family the child shall be adopted
from<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3500src" href="#xd20e3500" name=
"xd20e3500src">8</a> is a question that is hard for a man and his wife
to agree upon, the wife naturally wishing to adopt from her family and
the husband from his. Sometimes two children are adopted, one from each
family. More often the adopted child is married to one of the family of
the unrelated parent. The two parents by adoption then give or will
give their children by adoption a large part or nearly all of their
properties. They may not give the adopted children <i>all</i>. They
must give something to those who would have been their heirs had they
not made the adoption.</p>
<p id="s25">25. <i>Servants.</i>&mdash;The general term for servants is
<i>baal</i>. As a rule no pay is given a servant other than his board
and clothing. It is the obligation of the master, however, to furnish
animals for sacrifice when the servant falls sick. It is, further,
considered good form for the master to furnish animals for sacrifice in
case of sickness of the servant&rsquo;s father or mother; but I do not
believe it to be an obligation. A servant that has been a long time
with his master is called <i>nikkop</i>. It is an obligation resting on
the master to furnish the animals and other necessities for a marriage
feast for such a servant. As a rule there is no definite time set for
the termination of a contract between master and servant, and such
contracts are terminable at any time at the will of either party.</p>
<p>Sometimes an unmarried adult goes to the house of a rich man and
asks to be taken as a member of the family on such a basis; but as a
rule servants are children when first taken. Oftentimes a high degree
of affection is felt for a faithful member of the family of this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3525" href="#xd20e3525" name=
"xd20e3525">35</a>]</span>class, and if a child he is treated as a son
or daughter. Sometimes a rice field is assigned to him, and he inherits
as though he were the youngest son or daughter.</p>
<p id="s26">26. <i>Slaves.</i>&mdash;Before the American occupation,
except in those few parts of the habitat that were prosperous and in
which the obtaining of the daily ration was not a serious problem, the
selling by parents who found themselves poverty stricken of one of
their children was not at all uncommon. The price that a child brought
his parents varied from five pigs to five carabaos. There was no
difference in value between a male and a female child. A slave was most
valuable at the age of eighteen or twenty. Some men were slave dealers,
and carried great numbers of children to Nueva Vizcaya and Isabela. In
those parts a slave was worth from five to twenty carabaos.</p>
<p>Among the Ifugao a slave was absolutely the property of his owner.
The latter had power of life and death over him. Even if the master
killed the slave it was not considered that the slave&rsquo;s family
would be justified in avenging the death. But a slave&rsquo;s children,
even though they be the children by another slave parent, were free.
Frequently one of them was assigned to take the place of the father and
another of the mother, and these two then became free. In the lowlands,
however, the children of slaves were slaves, which accounts partly for
the higher prices paid for slaves in those parts. It would be
interesting to know whether the lowland (Christian) Filipino held
children of slaves as slaves before his civilization and
christianization by the Spaniard, or whether his practice then was that
of his Ifugao brethren.</p>
<p>The purchase of a slave was celebrated by a very pretentious series
of religious ceremonials. Oftentimes, with the Ifugao, a slave was set
free, at or before the death of his master, and was given a rice field.
Unless set free he was inherited by the master&rsquo;s heirs as any
other property. Sometimes a slave child was adopted by a childless
couple as their own son or daughter.</p>
<p>The following &ldquo;Pocahontas&rdquo; story is told of a slave who
lived at his master&rsquo;s house in Anao. The master treated him ill,
and the slave, a young man, ran away. He went to the enemy village of
Alimit. The men of that town were going to kill him, hearing his Anao
accent, and believing him to be one of their hereditary enemies. But a
handsome girl, the daughter of a rich man, protected him with her own
body and begged for his life. She afterward married him and bought his
freedom. There was no actual necessity for her buying his freedom,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3538" href="#xd20e3538" name=
"xd20e3538">36</a>]</span>since the last thing in the world the Anao
master could have accomplished would have been the recovery of his
property. She bought his freedom, however, in order that the children
of herself and her husband might never be called the &ldquo;offspring
of a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mention should be made, also, of those who voluntarily entered into
slavery as a means of paying a debt. The word &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo;
in this connection needs explanation, however. A man was usually
frightened into entering into servitude by the probability that if he
did not he would be killed.</p>
<p>In parts of Ifugao, the killing of women or children in feuds was a
disgraceful thing, and rarely, if ever, practiced. Instead they were
made prisoners and sold for debt. Sometimes, too, women or children
were carried off and held for debt. This form of collection of debts
was legal, or at least semi-legal. In case the debt was paid, the
captive was returned; otherwise, he was sold as a slave.</p>

<h3 class="main">Illegitimate Children</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s27" class="first">27. <i>Definition of illegitimacy; its
frequency.</i>&mdash;A bastard is one whose father refuses to take the
mother as his legal wife for any period of time, however short. The
marriage of the parents after the birth of the bastard, consequently,
legitimizes the child.</p>
<p>Bastardy is not very frequent. It is extremely frequent, however,
for a girl to become pregnant before her marriage. But in such cases
her lover usually marries her. It is usually in cases of doubtful
parentage and in cases in which one of the parents is of vastly
different status as to wealth that a marriage does not follow
pregnancy. But there are also a few cases of bastardy surrounded by
other circumstances.</p>
<p id="s28">28. <i>Obligations of father to bastard
child.</i>&mdash;The father of a bastard must give his child a rice
field if he has a field unassigned. He must also give the mother an
<i>oban</i>, or blanket, with which to carry the child after the Ifugao
fashion on her back. The value of this gift is principally in its
constituting a formal recognition of the child.</p>
<p>The mother&rsquo;s rights are enforced by her kin. To a certain
extent the same is true of the bastard&rsquo;s rights. A man is never
forced to marry a woman against his will&mdash;an Ifugao woman would be
ashamed to ask such a thing. Such a marriage, too, would not be
congenial. The mere making of a bastard a legitimate child is not of
sufficient importance to justify such a marriage. Besides, the Ifugaos
have a saying, <i>kumadangyang di inlaglaga</i>: &ldquo;The bastard
becomes a rich man.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3567"
href="#xd20e3567" name="xd20e3567">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Except in the matter of division of estates, the bastard has the
same rights as legitimate children. His father&rsquo;s kin back him in
legal procedures and avenge his wrongs as if he were legitimate. The
father and his kin assist him in his marriage feast and in other feasts
that may be necessary.</p>
<p id="s29">29. <i>Determination of parentage.</i>&mdash;The ordeal is
employed when two or more men are accused of being the father of a
bastard. The woman&rsquo;s word is not sufficient to settle the
parentage. The one she accuses may lay the matter at the door of
another. The ordeals used are the duel with <i>runo</i> stalks, or
eggs, and the hot water test. The woman, holding the babe in her arms,
sits half way between the two controversants.</p>
<p>The Ifugao has the remnant of a peculiar belief that a child may be
begotten by two fathers. They say, for example, that if A and B, two
men, are having sexual intercourse with a woman, Z, and that if it is
settled by fate that A and B each shall beget a child of the male sex,
Z will conceive and the child may be the son of both of them. But if A
is fated to beget a female child, and B to beget a male child, the
semen of the one undoes that of the other, and the woman does not
conceive. This belief is not taken seriously as a rule; but I have
heard it advanced in a case of illegitimate birth.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e3580src" href="#xd20e3580" name="xd20e3580src">9</a></p>
<p>Accordingly, should each of the two men be struck by the eggs thrown
in the duel to decide the parentage of the child, or should both be
scalded by hot water, the Ifugao, formerly at least, held that the
child belonged to each of them.</p>

<h3 class="main">Reciprocal Obligations of Parents and Their
Children</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s30" class="first">30. <i>Duties of parents to
children.</i>&mdash;The Ifugao family exists principally for the child
members of it. The parents are supposed to love, and do love their
children more than the children love them. The parents are under the
obligation to provide food and clothing for their children, and to
impart to them the tribal knowledge that is necessary to a respectable
and well regulated Ifugao life. The child may be forced to assist,
according to his ability, in the matter of household tasks, work in the
fields, and the like.</p>
<p>Corporal punishment may be, but <i>very rarely</i> is, administered.
It is the mothers, strange to say, rather than the fathers, who use
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3598" href="#xd20e3598" name=
"xd20e3598">38</a>]</span>form of punishment. I never saw or heard of a
father whipping his child. Such a thing as a right of life and death
over a child is as unthought of, as it would be abhorrent, to the
Ifugao if mentioned.</p>
<p>The Ifugao child, even at the age of ten or twelve, begins to look
upon his parents&rsquo; property as his own, or at least that portion
of it that will fall to his share. A little later, he becomes
independent&mdash;he does not obey his parents unless he wants to do
so. He is fully as likely to command them as to obey them. And the
parent is under the obligation early to allow the children to displace
him from his possession. He must turn over all his property to them as
soon as they are able to marry or care for themselves. Should there be
but a single field, he assigns it to his eldest. From the time that the
fields are turned over, the father&rsquo;s offices are those of priest
and counselor; the mother&rsquo;s offices are those of priestess
(sometimes) and of household drudge (always).</p>
<p id="s31">31. <i>Obligations of children to parents.</i>&mdash;The
obligations of children to their parents are:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To provide animals and other things requisite to
religious feasts that are thought necessary to keep them in good health
and to restore them when sick. This obligation is by far the most
burdensome one, usually.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To provide food and clothing for them, and to care for
them when sick or helpless.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To provide requisites for a funeral feast in accord with
the station of the deceased.</p>
<p>In case the child has not yet obtained possession of his allotment,
these obligations do not rest upon the child, but are a charge upon the
property <span class="corr" id="xd20e3624" title=
"Source: alloted">allotted</span> him. If the child has obtained
possession of his share in the family estate, the obligation rests upon
the child himself.</p>
<p>The law of primogeniture holds with respect to these obligations.
Civil obligations rest more heavily upon the older children and as
nearly as possible in proportion to the amounts of property received
from the parents. Children who receive no family property contribute
very little.</p>
<p>One might ask how compliance with these obligations is enforced.
Compliance with them is really not enforced. They are the most sacred
of all duties. Not to meet them would bring upon one&rsquo;s self such
universal reproach as to render life unbearable. <span class=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

a feeling on the part of the social consciousness that marriages ought
to be permanent&mdash;that it is better when such is the case.
Inasmuch, however, as all the uncles and aunts consider themselves,
and, in the scheme of the reckoning of Ifugao relationships are
considered, <i lang="la">in loco parentis</i> with respect to their
nephews and nieces, and almost equally bound with the parents
themselves to impart instruction and give training, the removal of one

<p id="s32" class="first">32. <i>The Ifugao&rsquo;s classification of
properties.</i>&mdash;The Ifugao clearly distinguishes between two
classes of property. His language, and indeed his thought, is very poor
in abstractions, however, and he bases his classification upon the
difference in the method of transferring property by sale. The one
class he calls <i lang="ifu">ma-ibuy</i>, &ldquo;that for whose
transfer by sale an <i lang="ifu">ibuy</i> ceremony is
necessary&rdquo;; and the other, <i lang="ifu">adi ma-ibuy</i>,
&ldquo;that for whose transfer by sale an <i lang="ifu">ibuy</i>
ceremony is not necessary.&rdquo; Classifying them upon their essential
differences in status in Ifugao law and culture, I term the former
family property and the latter personal property.</p>

<h3 class="main">Family Property</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s33" class="first">33. <i>The Ifugao attitude toward family
property.</i>&mdash;Family properties consist of rice lands, forest
lands, and heirlooms. The Ifugao attitude is that lands and articles of
value that have been handed down from generation to generation cannot
be the property of any individual. Present holders possess only a
transient and fleeting possession, or better, occupation, insignificant
in duration in comparison with the decades and perhaps centuries that
have usually elapsed since the field or heirloom came into the
possession of the family. Their possession is more of the nature of a
trust than an absolute ownership&mdash;a holding in trust for future
generations.</p>
<p>It is a misfortune when family property that has long been in the
possession of a family must be sold out of it. But if it be sold to a
member of another branch of the same family, the misfortune is
accounted less in proportion to the nearness of the kinship. However,
the rights of the living and of the ancestors departed, are greater
than the rights of the unborn. Consequently, a field may properly be
sold and so depart from the family, if it be in order to provide
animals to accompany the spirit of a deceased ancestor to the spirit
world, or in order to provide animals for sacrifices to secure the
recovery from dangerous sickness of some member of the family.
Inherited property, however, is not to be disposed of without
exhausting every effort to keep it within the family. Nor must it ever
be disposed of for light or trivial reasons. Except when sold to
satisfy the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3665" href="#xd20e3665"
name="xd20e3665">40</a>]</span>needs of the departed or living (in
these cases, a forced sale) family properties when sold bring
exorbitant prices. Fields or other properties which have been recently
acquired or constructed, sell at considerably lower prices, even though
their intrinsic value be the same.</p>
<p>Nothing that I know of in the Ifugao make-up, is so
characteristically oriental as is this subordination of individual to
family rights.</p>
<p id="s34">34. <i>Rice lands.</i>&mdash;A &ldquo;field&rdquo; consists
of all the contiguous paddies in one place that are the property of one
man. In sales and in transfers arising out of family relationship, and
in <i lang="ifu">balal</i> (pawning), a field is never divided. If
there be two heirs and only one field to be inherited, the elder of the
heirs takes the entire field. The reason for this and for the rights of
primogeniture (see <a href="#s53">sec. 53</a>) in inheritance and
assignment of property, is to be found in the fact that the Ifugao
social consciousness considers it better&mdash;and it is
better&mdash;that a family have at least one powerful member round whom
the kin may rally and to whom they may look for aid, than that the
family property be split into insignificant parcels that would affect
but little the property of all. Aside from this consideration there is
also the practical difficulty of dividing a field. In the process of
dividing, the family unity&mdash;which is the dearest and most
necessary thing in Ifugao society&mdash;would probably be destroyed by
quarrels and squabbles. Even if an equitable division could be
arranged, a great deal of the field would be taken up in dikes and
division lines. It is a rare thing to find an Ifugao rice field as
large as one acre in extent.</p>
<p>There is no formal recognition of the eldest as the head of the
family. But together with the lion&rsquo;s share of the property, the
first-born inherits certain well defined and rather stringent
obligations. In this we seem to have the savor of a system of
patriarchy.</p>
<p id="s35">35. <i>Forest lands.</i>&mdash;Such lands, valuable
principally because of the woods upon them, are often the common
property of a group of kinsmen and their families. They are sometimes
partitioned. They are nearly sure to be partitioned if wood be scarce,
or if part of the land be suitable for rice fields.</p>
<p id="s36">36. <i>Heirlooms.</i>&mdash;Heirlooms consist of such
articles as gold neck-ornaments (intrinsic value of the gold being
about 10 pesos to 20 pesos; current price among the Ifugaos, 60 pesos
to 120 pesos); gongs (value 8 pesos to 250 pesos); rice-wine jars
(value 60 pesos to 400 pesos); <i lang="ifu">pango</i>, or strings of
amber colored glass beads (value 80 pesos to 160 pesos); and <i lang=
"ifu">bungol</i>, long strings of agates and bloodstones which are very
rarely sold (value about 250 pesos). These articles <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3698" href="#xd20e3698" name=
"xd20e3698">41</a>]</span>are used fully as much by the owner&rsquo;s
kin as by the owner himself; for they wear the beads and ornaments,
play the gongs in feasts, and brew rice wines in the jars.</p>
<p id="s37">37. <i>Sale of family property.</i>&mdash;The selling of
rice fields, forest lands, gold neck-ornaments, rice-wine jars, and the
like is a matter of practical concern to the entire family. Selling
them, except in cases of necessity and after consultation with the kin,
would lead to ill feeling toward the seller on the part of his kin, and
a refusal to assist and back him. Since there is no form of political
government in Ifugao culture, and since every man must, with the help
of his kin, &ldquo;get his own justice,&rdquo; this would be no small
punishment. How serious a punishment it would be, the reader will,
perhaps, realize when he reads the chapter on procedure.</p>
<p>The sale of family property is registered by ceremonies in which the
near kin of both buyer and seller take part. In comparison with the
solemnity of these transfers, our real estate transfers are
commonplace. In comparison with their complexity, our transfers are
simplicity itself.</p>

<h3 class="main">Personal Property</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s38" class="first">38. <i>Definition.</i>&mdash;Such articles as
knives, spears, dishes, baskets, pots, houses, <i>camote</i> fields,
fruit-bearing trees, blankets, animals and articles of minor value, are
on the same legal basis as personal property among ourselves. Three
items in this list demand special attention: houses, valuable trees,
and sweet potato fields.</p>
<p id="s39">39. <i>Houses.</i>&mdash;Dwellings are movable property in
Ifugao. A man, with the aid of his kinsmen can, and frequently does,
take a house to pieces, move it to a different site and set it up again
before sunset. The plot on which a house stands has no value. The value
of a house is usually about ten pesos, the range of prices being from
six to sixty pesos.</p>
<p id="s40">40. <i>Valuable trees.</i>&mdash;Cocoanut trees, coffee
trees, and areca palms are sold without any sale or transfer of the
land on which they stand. The value of a cocoanut tree in full bearing
is five pesos; of a coffee tree, one to two pesos; of an areca palm
one-half peso. As a rule, the land on which these trees stand has no
value. A practice presenting parallel features that leads one to
believe that the same manner of selling trees must have prevailed among
the Pangasinanes, one of the Christian tribes, is that, in the sale of
the cocoanut groves in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3728" href=
"#xd20e3728" name="xd20e3728">42</a>]</span>central Pangasinan, the
trees are sold at so much apiece; but in order to get possession of the
trees, it is necessary to buy the land at so much a hectare, since the
land has a value.</p>
<p><i>Camote</i> or sweet potato fields are discussed in section
45.</p>
<p>No ceremonials are involved in the transfer of personal property;
nor are witnesses necessary, as a general thing.</p>

<h3 class="main">Perpetual Tenure</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tenure is either perpetual or transient.</p>
<p id="s41">41. <i>Rice and forest lands.</i>&mdash;Rice-land and
forest-land tenures are perpetual.</p>
<p>In case an owner abandons a rice field for any period of time,
however long, and another man takes up the field without interference
or contrary order of the true owner, clears it of underbrush, builds up
the broken dikes, levels once more the terraces, tills and plants it,
the latter has the right to use the field for the same number of years
that it was abandoned. At the end of this time, the field reverts to
the true owner. Should the owner desire possession of his field before
the expiration of the time, for which, in accordance with this rule,
the field should remain in the possession of him who redeemed it from
the wild mountain side, he must repurchase possession.</p>
<p>It is not incumbent on a man to secure permission of the owner of an
abandoned field before working it; it is incumbent on the owner to
prevent others from working his field against his will.</p>
<p>In the event a rice field is made on privately owned forest lands
from which the timber has long been cut, the owner of the land, when he
has proved title, demands payment for the land. But he may not take
advantage of the labor that the other has spent on the land in making
rice fields, to demand an exorbitant payment. To take such a course
would invite danger to himself.</p>
<p>Forest lands that have been divested of their wood may be planted in
<i>camotes</i> (sweet potatoes) by any person without asking the
consent of the owner. If the owner does not want his land so planted or
intends to use it himself, it is his business to inform any who may
have started to work the land. But if he is tardy in making this
prohibition, he must pay for the labor expended, or must allow the
continuance of the work, and the harvesting of one crop of camotes from
the land. I am not certain that this is the case in all parts of
Ifugao. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3757" href="#xd20e3757"
name="xd20e3757">43</a>]</span></p>
<p id="s42">42. <i>&ldquo;Homesteading.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;That land
which is not rice fields or forest land and which is not owned by some
individual by reason of its having been one or the other formerly,
becomes the property of whomsoever makes it into rice fields. The
tenure so acquired is perpetual.</p>
<p id="s43">43. <i>Paghok, or landmarks.</i>&mdash;Whenever a
rice-field terrace is walled, the terrace wall is an unfailing and
unimpeachable landmark. But in many districts, the terraces are not
walled. In such cases, the division lines between fields are marked by
large chunks of wood or by large stones, buried three or four feet deep
along the division line. A boulder is of course a most excellent
landmark.</p>
<p>Weather and the elements are continually wearing back an unwalled
terrace. The amount each year is very small. But when in the course of
years the displacement is sufficient to justify it, the owner may take
that part of the field in the terrace below that belongs to him.</p>
<p>The moving of a landmark is said never to occur, since it would take
two or three men to lift the heavy stones, and would require a long
time. Moreover it could not be done without leaving plain and
indisputable evidence of the crime.</p>
<p id="s44">44. <i>Right of way through property owned by
others.</i>&mdash;In order to get rid of insect pests, clay is
sometimes conveyed to a field to form a layer over it about two inches
thick. The clay is shovelled into a stream of water above, and carried
as silt to the field and there allowed to settle. Sometimes leaf mold
and other fertilizers are conveyed to a field in this manner.</p>
<p>It makes no difference how many fields there may be above that on
which it is desired to deposit the sediment, the owner of the last has
a right to cut a ditch through the upper fields as a conduit for the
stream of water. He must, however, repair all the upper terraces so as
to leave them as they were before.</p>

<h3 class="main">Transient Tenure</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s45" class="first">45. <i>Tenure of sweet potato
fields.</i>&mdash;Sweet potato, or <i>camote</i>, fields are clearings
on the mountain sides about the village. They are nearly always steep
slopes, and quickly lose their fertility. For that reason, they are
abandoned after a period that varies in different districts of Ifugao
according as <i>camotes</i> are a more or less important factor in the
subsistence of the people. Thus in Banaue, where <i>camotes</i> form a
very large part of the subsistence of the people, the fields are
cultivated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3797" href="#xd20e3797"
name="xd20e3797">44</a>]</span>for five or even six years, if located
near the village; if more distant, they are abandoned after about two
years. In Kiangan, where <i>camotes</i> do not play such an important
part in subsistence, the fields are in any case abandoned after one or
two years. The reason for abandoning the fields is that the soil wears
out soon, so that the <i>camotes</i> grow small, and the yield does not
repay the labor spent in cultivation. But in case a large area about
the village be cultivated, rather than face the necessity of going far
from the village to make clearings, the old fields are tended to a
point at which the yield becomes almost <i>nil</i>. After abandoning a
field, the owner still has a claim on it, but only until such time as
the field grows up in weeds, in which case the labor spent by him in
making the clearing may be fairly presumed to have been undone. After
abandonment, the field regains its fertility slowly. The first person
who begins clearing the field again becomes its possessor for a new
term of years. It is exceedingly rare that quarrels arise over
<i>camote</i> fields. <i>Camote</i> fields are sometimes sold, but it
is not the land that is sold, but the crop with temporary possession of
the land.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Transfers of Property for a Consideration</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are two kinds of transfer of family property for
&ldquo;consideration&rdquo;: the <i>balal</i> (pawn), and outright
sale.</p>
<p id="s46">46. <i>The balal.</i>&mdash;In case a man finds himself
under the necessity of raising a considerable sum of
money&mdash;usually in order to provide funds for a funeral feast or a
sacrifice&mdash;he frequently borrows the sum, giving a rice field into
the hands of his creditor as a security and as a means of paying the
interest on debt. The creditor holds, plants, and harvests the field
until the debt be repaid. The field is to all purposes his, except that
he cannot sell it. He can, however, transfer it as a <i lang=
"ifu">balal</i> into the hands of another. But he must transfer it for
the same or a less amount of money; that is, if he has loaned fifty
pesos on the field, he must not borrow more than that sum, unless, of
course, he be able to secure the owner&rsquo;s consent. This is a very
wise provision of Ifugao law that insures the prompt return of the
field to the owner as soon as he be able to get together the amount
needed to redeem the field. An example will make this clear. A borrows
fifty pesos of B, giving his field as a <i lang="ifu">balal</i> into
B&rsquo;s charge; B gives it as a <i lang="ifu">balal</i> to C for the
same or a less amount, who gives it as a <i lang="ifu">balal</i> to D
and so on. When A is able to repay the debt, he goes to B and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3841" href="#xd20e3841" name=
"xd20e3841">45</a>]</span>delivers him the sum plus the fee of the
agent through whom the deal was effected. With this amount, including
the fee, B goes to C, C goes to D, and so on. Were B to have borrowed
without A&rsquo;s consent more than fifty pesos, say seventy pesos, and
were he not financially able to obtain the difference (twenty pesos)
between his debt to C and the debt that A had just paid him, there
would be an excellent beginning for a quarrel that might end in lance
throwing.</p>
<p>Real estate of this kind continues in the hands of the creditor
until the debt be paid. Transfers of the same piece of land may go on
indefinitely. The transfers are witnessed each time by the agent who
obtains the loan for the person in whose charge the field is. This
agent receives as his fee about five to twelve per cent of the value of
the loan obtained. He is the only witness necessary. His fee is paid
him in the first place by the creditor. But the fee is added to the
amount loaned, and must be returned by the debtor when the debt is
paid. As soon as the agent has received his fee, it is his duty to
inform his oldest son, in case he be of sufficient age, otherwise his
wife or a brother, of the terms of the transaction. This is a
precautionary measure against his death and the consequent leaving of
the transaction without a witness.</p>
<p>Each creditor is liable to his debtor for the return of the field
upon the payment of the sum due, the case being precisely parallel to
the liability of the indorsers of a check or a note, one to
another.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, that the field be planted in rice. In such an
event, the owner must leave the creditor in possession of the field
until the crop shall have been harvested. In case the field be newly
planted, it is sometimes returned to the owner on the agreement that he
care for the growing crop, harvest it, and give the creditor half. If
the field be spaded, but not planted, the owner may pay his creditor
for the cost of the labor expended in spading the field, together with
a bonus as interest.</p>
<p>The amount loaned on a field never equals the value of the field.
Usually it is about half the value. It makes no difference how long a
field remain in the status known as <i lang="ifu">balal</i>, the field,
subject to the conditions of the preceding paragraph, <i>must be
returned to the owner or his heirs whenever the amount loaned be
returned</i>. Sometimes a field remains a <i lang="ifu">balal</i> for
two or three generations.</p>
<p id="s47">47. <i>Sales of family property.</i>&mdash;The Ifugao has a
very peculiar system of buying and selling in connection with family
property, by which, paradoxical as it may sound, a man has to pay for
an article <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e3865" href="#xd20e3865"
name="xd20e3865">46</a>]</span>almost twice its price. In order to
complete the purchase of a rice field, there are &ldquo;extras&rdquo;
almost without number, to be paid, each extra bearing as its
metaphorical name, the name of some act of rice-field cultivation or of
a feature of the trade itself. So far as has yet been ascertained,
there is no myth or story to explain how this peculiar idiosyncracy
originated.</p>
<p>The price is divided into ten parts, each part being represented by
a <i lang="ifu">runo</i> stick or a notch cut in a stick, or by knots
in a string. In the Banaue district, these sticks are kept for
generations as records of the sale. The first two sticks are called
<i lang="ifu">budut</i>, and represent the payment down. They are the
heaviest payments, not necessarily made on the day of the transfer, but
at a set time. The eight others represent some standard in the
Ifugao&rsquo;s system of barter, and are called <i lang=
"ifu">gatang</i>, or price. They are paid at some indefinite time in
the future. Possession of the field is given after the first payment.
In order to make the sticks conform to the standards of barter, it is
sometimes necessary to represent one payment by two sticks.</p>
<p><i>Fee of witnesses and agent.</i> This fee is called <i lang=
"ifu">lukbu</i>, or <i>lagbu</i> (in Benaue dialect). The principal
witnesses are preferably the distant kin of the seller, and the agent
or agents who effected the sale. The names of the different sticks,
knots, or notches are translated literally in the tables diagraming the
transactions in purchasing fields.</p>
<p>These fees are paid and the presents made to the kin of the seller
at a feast called <i lang="ifu">ibuy</i>. This feast is performed
whenever the purchase price of the field has been paid. The kin of
buyer and seller meet in the purchaser&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>One of the fine points in buying consists of an insidious
hospitality on the part of the purchaser, which gets the seller and his
kin drunk so that they forget some of their perquisites. At the
psychological moment, that is, when a few, but not all, of the presents
or <i lang="ifu">lukbu</i> have been made the seller and his kin, and
when the latter are at the proper stage of drunkenness, one of the
purchaser&rsquo;s kinsmen says: &ldquo;Let us proceed with the
praying.&rdquo; If he is successful in getting the religious part of
the ceremonies started, and can keep the minds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4620" href="#xd20e4620" name=
"xd20e4620">49</a>]</span>of the seller and his kin from the unpaid
gifts or fees until they eat, then the fees never have to be paid. For
when they have started eating, everything is over. They may demand the
unpaid fees only if they want to make themselves laughing stocks in the
eyes of their fellows. For according to Ifugao law, when the seller and
the purchaser eat together at the <i lang="ifu">ibuy</i> feast, the
transfer of ownership is complete, and irrevocable.</p>
<p>Although possession of the property is given before the purchase
price is paid, ownership of it is not, however, complete until after
the performance of the <i lang="ifu">ibuy</i>. <i>If one were to buy a
field without performing the</i> ibuy <i>ceremony, the presumption
would be held that the field had passed into his hands as a</i> balal.
It has been noted already that but one or two of the unit payments are
made at the time possession is given, and that no particular time is
set for making the rest of the various partial payments. At any time
before the <i lang="ifu">ibuy</i> ceremonial which forever transfers
the field, the seller may demand a payment or <i>all</i> the payments,
except the fees to the witnesses and his kin. He may do this as a
matter of malice, or he may do it as a matter of necessity. He sends a
<i lang="ifu">monkalun</i>, or go-between, to demand payment. The
go-between and the buyer arrange a reasonable time&mdash;usually not
less than ten days&mdash;within which the payment is to be raised. If
it be not then forthcoming, the field may revert to the former owner,
should the latter so desire, and be sold by him. He must, however,
return <i>immediately</i> the entire amount of the partial payments
made to date by the first purchaser.</p>
<p>In case of such a transfer of a field as that described in the
preceding paragraph, the same rules apply to the ownership of standing
crops as apply in transfers of possession arising from the <i lang=
"ifu">balal</i>.</p>
<p>But should the seller of a field, after having sold it to a second
person, and after having received a part of the purchase price of the
field from him, without consultation or notification, and without
giving this second person a chance to make the final payments on the
field, sell it to another, he must repay to the first purchaser double
the amount of the partial payments made by the first purchaser to the
date of the sale.</p>
<p>Personal property is transferred without formality.</p>
<p id="s48">48. <i>Responsibility of seller after property has left his
hands.</i>&mdash;In both Ifugao and Kalinga, if a rice field after
passing into the hands of a purchaser, is subject to an unusual number
of slides in the terrace wall, or is wholly, or in part washed away by
a freshet, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4663" href=
"#xd20e4663" name="xd20e4663">50</a>]</span>purchaser may, at any time
within the year following the purchase, relinquish the field and demand
the return of his purchase price. This is on the ground that the seller
may have put a curse on the field when it left his hands, or that, at
least, he did not relinquish his hold on its welfare and fertility.</p>
<p>In Kalinga, if a water buffalo, horse, or ox, die within the year
following its sale, the purchaser may demand the return of the purchase
price.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Transfers of Property Arising from Family
Relationships</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s49" class="first">49. <i>Methods of
transfer.</i>&mdash;Property is transferred within a family by two
methods: by assignment and transferal during the life of the owner; and
by inheritance.</p>
<p id="s50">50. <i>Assignment and transfer of property during the
lifetime of the owner.</i>&mdash;At some undefined time all the family
property that one possesses is assigned to his children. By
&ldquo;<i>assigned</i>,&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;provisionally
allotted,&rdquo; subject to any legitimate charge or obligation against
it. A family property is always subject to sale or pawn for the purpose
of providing funeral feasts, sacrifices in time of sickness or other
grave necessity, payments of fines, and indemnities, made on behalf of
lineal ascendants and descendants and near collateral kin. The property
is usually assigned when the children are quite small.</p>
<p>Property is transferred (that is to say, possession is given) to the
children when they marry and separate from the household of the
parents. By the time the youngest child has so separated, or even
before, the parents have become a charge on their children. It is only
sometimes, in the case of the very rich, that a portion of the property
is reserved. Childless widowed aunts or uncles usually transfer their
property to those who would otherwise inherit it, and so become a
charge upon those persons.</p>
<p id="s51">51. <i>Inheritance.</i>&mdash;It is only in case of the
death of the parents when the children are very small, or of the death
of a more distant relative from whom it is inherited, that the Ifugao
receives property by inheritance.</p>
<p id="s52">52. <i>The passing of property between relatives because of
relationship.</i>&mdash;The same laws govern both the assignment and
transfer of property while the possessor is yet living, and the
inheritance of property. Of all Ifugao laws, they are the most definite
and the most invariably followed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e4695" href="#xd20e4695" name="xd20e4695">51</a>]</span></p>
<p id="s53">53. <i>The law of primogeniture.</i>&mdash;By this law, the
elder children inherit a greater portion of the property than the
younger ones, the proportion being governed by the ordinal rank of the
children as to birth. If there be but one rice field, the eldest takes
it. Because of his greater wealth, the eldest is frequently the family
leader, counselor, and advocate. He has no actual authority over his
brothers and sisters, however&mdash;indeed no person in Ifugao society
has authority over another.</p>
<p id="s54">54. <i>The passing of property to legitimate sons and
daughters by assignment or inheritance.</i></p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) No distinction is made because of sex.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The greatest proportion of an estate goes to the eldest
child.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) If the number of children be greater than the number of
rice fields, the elder children take the fields. If there be but one
field, the eldest takes it.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) If all the children inherit rice fields, the heirlooms
and personal property are divided in accordance with the laws of
primogeniture that apply to real estate.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) If there be children that inherit no rice fields, a
slight compensation is made them by giving them a larger share of the
heirlooms and personal property than would fall to their lot otherwise.
This compensation by no means equals the value of the real estate they
would inherit under our laws.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) In the event of the death of either spouse before the
property of the spouses has been allotted to the children, the living
spouse allots the property to the children at the proper time. In this
allotment, the brothers of the dead spouse are usually called in
consultation. The living spouse may not deviate from custom in
allotting the property of the deceased. All the property of both the
spouses must be allotted at this time. None may be held back.</p>
<p id="s55">55. <i>The passing of property to other
relatives.</i>&mdash;In the apportionment or inheritance of property in
which blood relatives other than sons and daughters benefit, two
general principles hold:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Property received from the father goes to the
father&rsquo;s family; property received from the mother goes to the
mother&rsquo;s family. The families of the two parents coalesce in, and
are identical in, their children and their childrens&rsquo;
descendants.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) So near as may be, those persons inherit who would have
inherited the property had the deceased never lived. It is only in the
case of the childless that others than sons and daughters have rights
in the property left. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4752" href=
"#xd20e4752" name="xd20e4752">52</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>If the deceased were unmarried</i>, his property goes to his
relatives in the following order:</p>
<p>(1) To his brothers and sisters, if living. To the brothers and
sisters descended from one parent, passes that portion of the property
received from that parent; to the brothers and sisters descended from
the other parent, that portion of the property received from that
parent.</p>
<p>(2) To the nephews and nieces, the offspring of the brothers and
sisters, or to their descendants.</p>
<p>(3) To the cousins in order, first of degree, and second of
primogeniture.</p>
<p><i>If the deceased were married</i>, in the the inheritance of his
property there are the following rules:</p>
<p>(1) The living spouse inherits the sole right in, and possession of,
half the property jointly acquired by the spouses subsequent to their
marriage. It is not, properly speaking, the <i>property</i> that is
inherited: it is the <i>sole right</i> in what was a joint possession
before.</p>
<p>(2) That half of the property jointly acquired by the spouses which
is the share of the deceased, goes to his heirs, being divided (if his
heirs be not his brothers and sisters or their descendants) equally
between the heirs on the father&rsquo;s side, and those on the
mother&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>(3) The property that the deceased brought to the marriage and that
which he acquired subsequently owing to and by virtue of his
relationship to his family, goes to the deceased&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Personal property acquired by the deceased and his spouse is not,
however, taken from the surviving spouse. The above applies only to
family property.</p>
<p id="s56">56. <i>Property rights of bastards.</i>&mdash;Bastards
usually inherit approximately half the property of a father who dies
without legitimate children, the other half going to those who would be
the sole heirs had the father died childless. But if there be only one
field, the bastard takes it.</p>
<p>Should a parent have only one legitimate child, the bastard inherits
usually as if he were a <i>younger</i> legitimate child.</p>
<p>A bastard is entitled to a rice field from his father if the father
has a rice field that is unassigned to a legitimate child. He is not
entitled to any special value of fields, and as a rule, receives less
than his legitimate brothers and sisters if there be such.</p>
<p>The above paragraphs apply equally to the bastard&rsquo;s right in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4796" href="#xd20e4796" name=
"xd20e4796">53</a>]</span>the property of his mother. He has, however,
no kin to enforce his rights against his mother. Since he is of
illegitimate birth, the kin of the father are not in a position to
enforce his rights against her; while his mother&rsquo;s kin would not
take issue in any matter for him against their nearer kin, his mother.
If the mother marries after the birth of the bastard, she usually makes
a settlement on her bastard child before marrying. Not infrequently he
who marries a woman having a bastard child recognizes that child as his
own, and even assigns him a portion of his property. The following are
examples:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Dulnuan and Ngahiu of Tupplak carried on a courtship,
after the Ifugao fashion, in the <i lang="ifu">agamang</i> (dormitory).
Ngahiu became pregnant; but Dulnuan refused to marry her. However, and
notwithstanding the fact that he knew her to be pregnant, a third
party, Baliu, married Ngahiu. From what motive he did this does not
appear: it was probable that he gained financially, since Ngahiu was
wealthier than he; and being pregnant as she was, she was in no
position to stipulate too closely as to the property of the one who
might become her husband. The bastard child, notwithstanding the fact
that there were legitimate half brothers and sisters, was given fields
by (<i>a</i>) his mother; (<i>b</i>) his natural father, Dulnuan;
(<i>c</i>) Baliu, who recognized him as his son.</p>
<p>R, a Christianized Ifugao woman, and a wife who had borne five
legitimate children to B, her husband, was indiscreet in her relations
with a Spaniard. She bore a <i>mestizo</i> child. B, her husband, did
not proceed against his wife and her paramour according to Ifugao law
and recognized the child as his own. The legitimate children except one
having died, the bastard child inherited from his mother and his
mother&rsquo;s husband as if he had been of legitimate birth.</p>
</div>
<p>There is a Malay proverb which is used to describe the attitude of
the husband in such cases as the above: &ldquo;Although I did not plant
the tree, yet it grew in my garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amount of property that parents settle on a bastard is to a
great extent a matter of caprice. His rights to any property whatever,
except a single field from his father, are decidedly weaker than those
of children of legitimate birth, added to which he has not the right in
any case to so great a portion of property.</p>
<p id="s57">57. <i>Transfers of property to adopted
children.</i>&mdash;Customs relating to these transfers are as
follows:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) An adopted child related to only one of the spouses may
inherit from that spouse only.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) If the adopted child be a niece or nephew, he inherits or
has assigned him all the property of the related parent; provided that
there be no brothers or sisters of the related parent except the
adopted child&rsquo;s own blood parents. If there be other brothers and
sisters, and if these brothers and sisters agree to help stand the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4839" href="#xd20e4839" name=
"xd20e4839">54</a>]</span>funeral expenses of the adopting brother or
sister, a small part of the property is given them. But the adopted
child inherits the greater part of the property.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) If the adopted child be the son or daughter of a cousin,
there is assigned him, or he inherits all the property that his parents
would inherit in case of the death of the related parent, and a portion
in addition. Should the parents not be in the position of being likely
to become heirs to the related adopting parent, the adopted child
inherits, or has assigned him, only a minor portion of the estate. If
there be no brothers and sisters of the parent by adoption, he may have
assigned him the greater portion of the estate, however.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) If the adopted child be not related by blood to either of
the parents by adoption, he inherits, or has assigned him, a small
portion of the estate of both adopting parents. The kin of these
parents take the lion&rsquo;s share of the estate.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) If the adopted child marry a kinsman of the unrelated
adopting parent, the unrelated parent usually settles on the spouse of
the adopted child, an amount of property about equal to that settled on
the adopted child by his kinsman, his other adopting parent, subject,
however, to the four rules above.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) It is optional with the blood parents of an adopted child
to settle no property on him, in case the parents by adoption provide
for him in this respect.</p>
<p>The above settlements are customary. They can hardly be said to be
rights, however. Often when a child is adopted, his blood parents
stipulate with those who adopt as to the property settlement that will
be made on the child.</p>
<p id="s58">58. <i>Servants and slaves as
inheritors.</i>&mdash;Retainers have no rights whatever as to the
property of their masters. Frequently, however, a small field is
settled on them.</p>
<p id="s59">59. <i>Wills and testaments.</i>&mdash;There are no wills
or testaments among the Ifugaos. If a man desires to make a settlement
of his property that is out of the ordinary, he must do it before he
dies. Even then he would have to get the family&rsquo;s consent to the
unusual features. Ifugao parents are singularly impartial in the
allotment of the family property to their children. That some children
are not loved more than others is unbelievable; but it is exceedingly
rare that any child is favored above another in property settlements,
except by the law of primogeniture. There is always a lot of talk in
connection with the assignment or inheritance of family
property&mdash;in the matter of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e4873" href="#xd20e4873" name="xd20e4873">55</a>]</span>talk the
Ifugao is not different from other Malays. But it is not often that
permanent ill feeling is engendered in such settlements. The laws of
the descent of property are, as has been said, the clearest and most
concise of all Ifugao laws.</p>

<h3 class="main">Settlement of Debts of the Aged and Deceased</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s60" class="first">60. <i>When the debtor has
children.</i>&mdash;At the same time that the wealth of the family is
apportioned to the children, account is taken of the debts owed by the
family. The debts may or may not be individually apportioned among the
children. <i>If the eldest child inherits or receives any property</i>,
the obligation of primogeniture holds as to the debts; that is to say,
he is responsible for the payment of a greater proportion of them.
Otherwise all the children are equally responsible. There are many
cases in which the debts that are handed down by an Ifugao&rsquo;s
parents greatly exceed the property handed down.</p>
<p>Children who receive no family property are not responsible for the
payment of the debts of the parents, <i>provided there be a child or
children that do receive family property</i>. The apportionment of the
debts of the deceased must be in proportion to the amount of property
received. If none receive family property, all are responsible for
payment.</p>
<p id="s61">61. <i>When the debtor is childless but leaves a
spouse.</i>&mdash;A spouse is responsible only for those debts incurred
in behalf of the couple&rsquo;s mutual interests: for example, debts
incurred in obtaining animals for sacrifice in case of sickness of the
children of the couple, or for sacrifice at the funeral feasts of the
children, or for the purchase of rice fields or other joint possessions
of the spouses. A spouse may not be held for debts incurred in the
purchase of animals for sacrifice at the funeral feast of a member of
the other&rsquo;s family (except for the pig and death blanket due from
her family in such cases), nor for debts incurred in paying fines or
indemnities levied as a result of the other&rsquo;s misdoing. A spouse
may not even be held for debts incurred in providing sacrifices to
secure the recovery of her husband from sickness (except for the pig
due as stated under section 13; however, this pig is really her own
obligation).</p>
<p id="s62">62. <i>Debts for which the kin of the deceased are
held.</i>&mdash;When a debtor dies childless, the kin who inherit, if
there be such, must pay debts that were incurred on behalf of their
family. They are, too, jointly responsible with the wife, for these
debts incurred on behalf <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4901" href=
"#xd20e4901" name="xd20e4901">56</a>]</span>of the debtor&rsquo;s
descendants. If there be nothing inherited, all the kin are responsible
for these debts in proportion to nearness of the kinship.</p>
<p>It is a matter of doubt as to whether a man&rsquo;s kin or his
spouse can be held for his gambling debts. Such debts are purely
personal, and are about the only debts that an Ifugao contracts in his
own selfish interest. The Ifugaos did not gamble heavily, at least not
before the coming of the Spaniards; since their coming, custom in this
matter has not had time to crystallize.</p>
<p id="s63">63. <i>Attitude toward debts.</i>&mdash;A debt is a sacred
thing to an Ifugao. The non-payment of a debt is disgraceful. The
non-collection is still more disgraceful, for the presumption is that a
man who does not collect from his creditors cannot do so. If he cannot
collect his debts, it must be because he is a coward. In the babbling
that prevails about the rice-wine jar when tongues are loosened, one
who has debts long outstanding that other men would collect, hears
things not calculated to tickle his pride.</p>

<div id="ch3.9" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Borrowing and Lending</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To a far greater proportionate extent is borrowing and
lending carried on among the Ifugaos than in our own country. Almost
any event that carries with it a large payment or expenditure carries
with it as a corollary a large amount of borrowing. The things usually
borrowed are death blankets, animals for sacrifice, and rice.</p>
<p id="s64">64. <i>Lupe, or interest.</i>&mdash;Interest on things
borrowed is exceedingly high. But where borrower and lender are
brothers, no interest is charged; where they are kin of somewhat
remoter degree, a low interest, as a rule, is charged. In any case a
special agreement may be made by which the interest is not as high as
usual. It may be stated as a general principle that a thing borrowed
must be repaid by twice its value if paid soon&mdash;that is within a
year or even two years. But if repayment be made after a long time,
three perhaps, four times the value must be repaid. The Ifugao does not
hold to the calendar very severely in reckoning interest. But where
full interest is charged, the rule is that a thing borrowed must be
repaid by twice its value, even if it be paid within two weeks. Thus
rice borrowed two weeks before harvest time must be repaid by double
the quantity immediately after harvest.</p>
<p id="s65">65. <i>Patang, or interest paid in advance.</i>&mdash;This
is the Ifugao form of bank discount. It is interest paid in advance for
one year. On a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4925" href=
"#xd20e4925" name="xd20e4925">57</a>]</span>carabao (worth usually
about eighty pesos) this amounts to thirty pesos a year. At the end of
the year if the carabao be not paid back, the <i>patang</i> must be
followed by a second payment of the same quantity, called <i>unud</i>,
&ldquo;following,&rdquo; for the next year. If it be intended to repay
the carabao within three months, the interest in advance is ten pesos,
and is called <i>baloblad</i>.</p>
<p id="s66">66. <i>Another form of patang.</i>&mdash;Somewhat similar
is the fee or interest paid to the owner of anything seized by a man of
a different district or village to cover an unpaid indebtedness owed
the latter by a neighbor or co-villager of the former. It is the amount
of interest usually paid for one year; but there is no <i>unud</i> or
further payment, since it is presumed that by the end of the year the
delinquent neighbor ought to have been compelled to pay.</p>
<p>Thus A of one village owes C of another village a debt. After
several fruitless attempts to collect, C seizes a carabao belonging to
B, a co-villager of A. C sends a go-between to pay B thirty pesos,
telling him of A&rsquo;s debt, and informing him that he must get his
carabao back from A.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Go-betweens</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s67" class="first">67. <i>The go-between.</i>&mdash;No
transaction of importance of any sort between persons of different
families is consummated without the intervention of a middle man, or
go-between, called <i>monbaga</i> (bespeaker) in civil transactions;
and <i>monkalun</i> (admonisher) in criminal cases.</p>
<p>Go-betweens are used commonly in (<i>a</i>) buying and selling of
family property of whatever kind or value; (<i>b</i>) buying and
selling of animals and the more valuable personal property, except
chickens, and in some cases pigs; (<i>c</i>) the borrowing of money or
other wealth; (<i>d</i>) marriage proposals and the negotiating of
marriage contracts; (<i>e</i>) collection of debts; (<i>f</i>) all
steps connected with the <i>balal</i>, such as pawn of rice fields, or
their redemption; (<i>g</i>) demands for damages to property or
persons; (<i>h</i>) the buying back of heads lost in war, the ransoming
of the kidnapped, or the making of peace.</p>
<p>The go-between is the principal witness to a transaction. For his
services he receives pay which is fixed to a fair degree of exactness
for a particular service. This pay ranges from a piece of meat to a fee
of twenty or twenty-five pesos.</p>
<p id="s68">68. <i>Responsibility of go-betweens.</i>&mdash;Go-betweens
are responsible to both parties to a transaction, for the correct
rendering of tenders, offers, and payments. Their word binds only
themselves, however&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e4997"
href="#xd20e4997" name="xd20e4997">58</a>]</span>not their principals.
Go-betweens are not agents of one party more than another. They are
supposed to be impartial, and interested only in consummating the
transaction involved in order to get their fee.</p>
<p>Thus, suppose that A sends B as a go-between to sell a field to C, a
man of another district. B finds that he cannot sell the field for the
price A asked for it, and, anxious to consummate a sale and so collect
his fee, he agrees to sell the field to C for a lower price than that
asked by A.</p>
<p>In such a case as this, B is responsible to C in case A refuses to
abide by C&rsquo;s agreement to sell. C has the right to collect
damages.</p>
<p>The oriental propensity to &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; is proverbial. It
is condoned in law&mdash;one might almost say legitimized, provided it
be not found out. Thus:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">A sends B to Nueva Vizcaya to buy a carabao. The
regular commission for this service is ten pesos, the agent to deliver
a living carabao to the principal, and to be responsible for the value
if the carabao die on the route. This, the usual agreement, holds
between them. A furnishes B with eighty pesos with which to purchase
the animal. B returns with the animal, representing that he paid
seventy pesos for it, when, as a matter of fact, he paid out sixty
pesos, thus gaining ten pesos &ldquo;squeeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If A finds out that B paid only sixty pesos for the carabao, the
only thing he can do is to collect the ten pesos difference between
what A paid and what he said he paid. He cannot assess punitive
damages.</p>
</div>
<p id="s69"><span class="corr" id="xd20e5012" title=
"Source: 68">69</span>. <i>Conditions relieving a go-between of
responsibility.</i>&mdash;An act of God or the acts of a public enemy
relieve a go-between or an agent from responsibility. Thus an agent
sent to purchase an animal in <i>baliwan</i> (the stranger country) is
under obligation to deliver it alive. But if it be struck by lightning,
or if the carabao be taken away from him by enemies, and he has a wound
to bear witness that he offered due resistance to them; or, in case he
has no wound, if he has witnesses or good proof of the fact that the
enemy was so superior in force as to make resistance foolhardy, he
cannot be held for payment of the animal.</p>
<p id="s70">70. <i>Payment due those who find the body of one dead by
violence.</i>&mdash;An Ifugao who finds the body of one dead by
violence or drowning, and not an inhabitant of the same district as
himself, must perform a general welfare feast to remove the liability
to misfortune that is likely to result from such an incident.
Consequently, he is entitled to a payment, varying from one to ten
pesos, according to the rank of the dead person. If there be more than
one who encounter the dead body, all are entitled to the same payment.
This payment is called <i>halat</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Contracts for the Sale of Property</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s71" class="first">71. <i>On whom binding.</i>&mdash;Contracts
for the transfer of property for consideration are binding on the
seller only. Rarely, if ever, is there a payment to bind the bargain.
The simple promise to sell is sufficient to constitute a contract to
sell. The breaking of a contract to sell renders the breaker of the
contract liable for damages <i>only in case he took the initiative</i>
in making the contract.</p>
<p>Damages paid for the breaking of a contract to sell, are called
<i>hogop</i>. In case an agreement to sell a rice field is broken, the
damages are usually one large pig (fifteen or twenty pesos). In the
case of questions of this sort over minor property, the <i>hogop</i>
may be a death blanket, a small pig, or a chicken.</p>
<p>The following examples will serve to illustrate:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">A sends B as a go-between to sell a rice field. B
first contracts to sell the field to C. Later, knowing the terms of the
sale offered by A to be very advantageous, he sells the field to a
kinsman D.</p>
<p>In this case B is liable for the <i>hogop</i> to C.</p>
<p>In the above case B, after contracting to sell the field to C, duly
reports to A that C has accepted the terms offered, and that he is
raising the amount required for the first payment; that he will go
again by agreement with C to receive this first payment on such and
such a day. A sells the field to somebody else.</p>
<p>In this case A is liable to C for the <i>hogop</i>, and to B for his
fee as go-between.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>It becomes a matter of common knowledge that A has a gold
neck-ornament for sale. C agrees to purchase at the stated price and A
agrees to sell to him. A sells the ornament to somebody else.</p>
<p>A is not liable for the <i>hogop</i>, for the reason that C made the
first advances.</p>
</div>
<p>In no case can one who makes a contract <i>to buy</i> be held for
any payment of damages for breaking his contract.</p>

<h3 class="main">Irrigation Law</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s72" class="first">72. <i>The law as to new fields.</i>&mdash;If
all the land below a spring or small stream located on ownerless land,
be common land&mdash;that is, land without an owner&mdash;he who makes
the first rice field below the source of the water supply is entitled
to all the water needed for his rice field. Another man, making a rice
field between the field of the first comer and the source of the water
supply, may not use the spring or stream to the detriment of the first
comer.</p>
<p>But should a man make a field, be it on common or on owned land,
below a spring or stream, and should another man make a field between
the first field and the source of the water supply on <i>owned
land</i>, the second comer would have the right to whatever water might
be useful to him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e5095" href=
"#xd20e5095" name="xd20e5095">60</a>]</span></p>
<p id="s73">73. <i>The law as to water.</i>&mdash;Water which has been
flowing to an area of irrigated land may under no circumstances be
<i>diverted</i> to irrigate a different area, even though that area be
nearer the source of the water.</p>
<p>A person who acquires rice fields, one of which is near the source
of the water supply and the other at a considerable distance from it,
may not pipe or trough the water from the upper field to the lower one
if the water has meantime been irrigating an intervening area.
Thus:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Manghe of Ambabag, having a field near Baay, acquires
a field near Ambabag, about a quarter of a mile upstream from the
first. He threatens to put a line of troughs from one field to another
so as to supply sufficient water to the lower field. This action would
rob intervening fields of their accustomed water supply, and would be
illegal.</p>
</div>
<p>A spring belongs to him on whose land it is situated, and so also
does all the water issuing from the spring. The owner may sell the
surplus water to whom he pleases. The water rights so sold are
<i>perpetual</i>. Thus:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">A has a rice field in which there is a spring. He
sells the water to B, whose field is to one side&mdash;perhaps at a
considerable distance from A&rsquo;s. C has a field immediately below
A&rsquo;s. He purchases A&rsquo;s field and unites it with his own. But
he may not divert the water from A&rsquo;s original field to his own
original field, unless he buy the water right from B.</p>
</div>
<p id="s74">74. <i>The law as to irrigation
ditches.</i>&mdash;Constructors of an irrigation ditch may sell
interest in the ditch. The ditch thus shared with others becomes an
equal burden as to upkeep on all the owners.</p>
<p>The constructors of an irrigation ditch who have sold part of the
water from their ditch, must share the water in time of water scarcity
with those to whom they have sold, in proportion to the respective
areas of the rice fields. That is, every owner of an irrigation ditch
is entitled to a share proportionate to the area of his rice land, of
the water diverted by means of the ditch.</p>
<p>Repetition of the malicious destruction of an irrigation ditch, or
the turning of the water from it or out of it, is an offense punishable
by fine or even in some cases by death. The first offense, when the
culprit is discovered, is not punished; but there is a warning against
repetition.</p>
<p>Diversion of water from an irrigation ditch in which the diverter
has no interest is not a very serious offense. On the first offense the
diverter is warned. If he repeats it, all the water is drained from his
field or he is given a beating. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Penalties</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ifugaos have two punishments for crime: the death
penalty and fine. These punishments are inflicted and executed by the
offended person and his kin.</p>
<p id="s75">75. <i>Nature and reckoning of fines.</i>&mdash;Fines are
of two sorts: fines of &ldquo;tens,&rdquo; <i>bakid</i>, and fines of
&ldquo;sixes,&rdquo; <i>na-onom</i>, each unit of the ten or six being
a portion of the whole fine. The different parts of the fine go to
different people. Oftentimes sticks, knots, or notches are used to
assist in calculation. In Banaue and neighboring districts these aids
to calculation are also kept as a record. The unit payments grow
successively smaller from the first to the last.</p>
<p>The first unit of any series is called <i>pu-u</i>, meaning
&ldquo;base.&rdquo; It is of the greatest value, and goes to the
injured individual. The second payment, sometimes, goes to the
go-between. In that case, the kin of the injured man take all the rest.
If the fee of the go-between be provided for outside of the fine, the
kin of the injured man take all except the <i>pu-u</i>, the first unit.
This is but just, since they have backed their kinsman in his action
against the offender, have perchance risked their lives in his cause,
and also stand ready at all times to help pay any fines that others may
assess against him.</p>
<p>The second, and sometimes the third and fourth units, are called
<i>haynub di pu-u</i>, meaning &ldquo;followers of the base.&rdquo;
They are of less value than the <i>pu-u</i>. Then follow units
consisting, each, of four irons (spear-heads, axes, knives). These
units are called <i>natauwinan</i>. Then come units of three irons
each, called <i>natuku</i>; then units of two irons each, called
<i>nunbadi</i>; then units of one iron each, called <i>na-oha</i>. In
the case of fines composed of six units, there is usually no
<i>haynub</i>.</p>
<p>The Malay does nothing without first thoroughly talking it over.
After a payment has been tentatively consented to by the offender and
his family, there yet remain many conferences with the go-between
before everything is arranged. An uninitiated white man on seeing a
group of these people, squatted in a circle, moving little sticks
about, and in heated discussion, might think they were playing some
primitive but absorbing native game. And, I am not sure that the
attitude of their minds is very different!</p>
<p>The following tables of fines assessed for the four degrees of
adultery illustrate the manner of reckoning fines, their amounts, the
value of the units, as well as the fines proper to the three classes of
society in the Kiangan district. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>For adultery committed after the <i lang="ifu">bubun</i> (final
ceremony) the penalty is doubled for the higher classes, and increased
to a fine of &ldquo;ten&rdquo; for persons of the lower class. That is,
a poor man pays for adultery after the <i lang="ifu">bubun</i> what a
middle-class man would pay for adultery before the <i lang=
"ifu">bubun</i>.</p>
<p>For adultery in the aggravated degree known as <i lang=
"ifu">hokwit</i> (see <a href="#s94">sec. 94</a>) the fines just
mentioned are doubled; so that a wealthy man would pay 188 pesos, a
middle-class man 96.80 pesos, and a poor man 48.40 pesos. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Circumstances Which Affect Penalty</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Certain circumstances, namely, criminal
responsibility, alienship, kinship, confession, and the relative rank
of offender and offended, affect penalty, either as to its severity or
as to the likelihood of its being inflicted at all.</p>
<p id="s76">76. <i>Moral turpitude not a factor.</i>&mdash;Moral
turpitude, which plays no small part in our own law in determining
punishment, seems not to enter into the consideration of Ifugao law.
Thus, such crimes as incest between brother and sister, parricide,
matricide, fraticide, and treason against one&rsquo;s family, all go
unpunished. Even the betrayal of a co-villager into the hands of the
enemy subjects the offender to only a third degree of likelihood of
being punished (see <a href="#s80">sec. 80</a>). These crimes probably
go unpunished in accordance with the following correlated fundaments of
Ifugao society: Legal procedure is conducted by and between families;
the family unit is the most precious thing in Ifugao social life;
<i>family unity must, at all hazards, be preserved</i>. In the case of
a murder accomplished by treachery, as for example, the killing of a
guest, the moral turpitude involved might perhaps hasten
punishment&mdash;it might even increase its severity in that the kin of
the murdered person might retaliate on a greater number of those
concerned in the murder. But such an abuse of hospitality appears never
to have occurred.</p>
<p>Another reason why what we consider moral turpitude does not enter
into punishment is that treachery, ambush, and accomplishment by
superior force are the rule, not only in commission of crime, but also
in perfectly legal capital executions and seizures of property.</p>

<h3 class="main">Penal Responsibility</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As between principals and their accomplices and
accessories, Ifugao law recognizes only gradations in likelihood of
punishment. The penalty is the same for all of them; but very
frequently the offense is considered as having been expiated by the
punishment of those whose responsibility for it is greatest, and the
rest go free.</p>
<p id="s77">77. <i>The nungolat, or principal.</i>&mdash;The <i lang=
"ifu">nungolat</i> (he who was strong) is the conceiver, planner, and
director of an offense. He may or may not take an active part in its
commission. Whether or not he does so, he is considered to be
responsible for it in the highest degree. He is, of all who take part
in the offense, the most likely to be punished. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e5983" href="#xd20e5983" name=
"xd20e5983">64</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following example, continued through several succeeding
sections, shows the various degrees of criminal responsibility, and the
corresponding degrees of likelihood of punishment:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">A decides to avenge the death of a kinsman. He
consequently calls a number of his kinsmen and proposes a war
expedition to take the head of Z, an enemy concerned in the death of
the murdered kinsman, in another village. They agree. A calls the
family priests to his house to perform the necessary religious
preliminaries to setting out on a head-hunting expedition. The
ceremonies are performed, and the omen of the bile sac promises well.
But, just before starting, some accident happens to A, which the
priests attribute to the sorcery of the enemy. A consequently does not
accompany the expedition. He is, notwithstanding, the <i lang=
"ifu">nungolat</i>, and is more likely to be the object of vengeance
than any other, should the crime be accomplished.</p>
</div>
<p id="s78">78. <i>The tombok, or &ldquo;thrower.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;In
offenses in which a spear is thrown, he who throws the effective spear
is called the <i>tombok</i>. His responsibility for the crime is second
to that of the <i>nungolat</i>, as is also his likelihood of being
punished.</p>
<p id="s79">79. <i>Iba&rsquo;n di nungolat, the &ldquo;companions of
the one who was strong.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Those who assist in the
commission of a crime by reinforcing, accompanying, assisting, backing,
giving aid and comfort to the committer thereof, or furnishing anything
needful to the consummation of the crime incur the next lesser degree
of criminal responsibility and of likelihood of being punished to those
of the conceiver and committer of the crime.</p>
<p id="s80">80. <i>The montudol, &ldquo;shower,&rdquo; or
informer.</i>&mdash;One who gives a person in the act of committing a
crime information necessary to the successful carrying out of his
intent, is guilty in the same degree as are persons of the preceding
paragraph.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Thus, continuing the illustration started above,
suppose that B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I go to take the head of
A&rsquo;s enemy and theirs. They meet O, a co-villager of Z, the man
whose head they want to take, and ask him regarding Z&rsquo;s
whereabouts. The fact could not be otherwise than patent to O, that a
head-hunting party was addressing him. He answers truthfully that Z is
in his sweet potato field, and that the party may reach the field by
such and such by-path without their being seen by Z&rsquo;s kin or
co-villagers. The party follows O&rsquo;s directions. B spears Z.</p>
<p>B is the <i lang="ifu">tombok</i>; C, D, E, F, G, H, and I are the
&ldquo;companions of the one who was strong,&rdquo; and O is the
<i lang="ifu">montudol</i>.</p>
</div>
<p id="s81">81. <i>Servants who commit crimes at the bidding of their
masters.</i>&mdash;Retainers incur a lesser degree of criminal
responsibility than does the master. They will be punished if the
master cannot be punished. Sometimes both are punished. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6031" href="#xd20e6031" name=
"xd20e6031">65</a>]</span></p>
<p id="s82">82. <i>Likelihood of punishment.</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">(Continuation of illustration given above.) Z&rsquo;s
kinsmen of course decide to avenge his death. It is a general rule that
all debts must be paid with liberal interest, the interest being at
least equal to the debt. The debt of life is no exception to this rule.
The kinsmen, whom we will call Q, R, S, T, and U, decide that, at
least, they will kill A, the <i lang="ifu">nungolat</i>, and B, the
<i lang="ifu">tombok</i>, and that if opportunity offers they will kill
one or two of the others. They go to the vicinity of the village of A
and B and lie in wait for them. They may do this a number of times.
Finally we will suppose that they kill A. Their thirst for blood is
somewhat appeased, and they may not pursue their first intention. But
it would be the part of wisdom for B to be extremely cautious.
Z&rsquo;s kinsmen are likely to make an expedition or two to take his
head.</p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose that A dies a natural death or falls in
some other feud. The full likelihood of punishment now falls on B.</p>
<p>Suppose that B, H, and O walk past the place of ambush of the
avengers. The latter will try to make sure of B, but will also try to
kill the other two.</p>
<p>Suppose that B, like A, meets death in some other way than at the
hands of Z&rsquo;s avengers. C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and O are now equally
likely to be punished.</p>
<p>In case several unsuccessful expeditions are made to secure the head
of A and B, the avengers are likely to take a head or heads from some
of the others rather than continually to place themselves in jeopardy
by their expeditions into an enemy region. Especially is this true if
the enemy&rsquo;s village be distant. If the villages be near, it is
probable that C, D, E, F, G, H, I, or O might walk past the ambush of
the avengers at first with impunity, since the avengers are desirous of
taking the heads of the principals, and do not want to put the
principals on their guard by slaying those whose guilt is less.</p>
</div>
<p id="s83">83. <i>Drunkenness and insanity in relation to criminal
responsibility.</i>&mdash;Except in the case of murder, drunkenness
mitigates the severity of punishment, provided there be no evidence to
show that the culprit became intoxicated with the intent to commit the
crime, and provided he sincerely repents on becoming sober. Even
insanity is not an alleviating circumstance in the case of murder; but
it is one in all other crimes.</p>
<p id="s84">84. <i>The relation of intent to criminal
responsibility.</i>&mdash;<i lang="ifu">Gulad</i> or intent, is
probably the greatest single factor in determining penal
responsibility. Thus:</p>
<p>A deed committed without intent, and without carelessness, is
excused. One has not, usually, even to make restitution for the injury
done. Thus, in the case of a bolo flying out of a man&rsquo;s hand, and
putting out the eye of another, no damages were assessed. An enormous
number of men, every year, are injured in the free-for-all scrambles
over sacrificed carabaos. Many of these injuries result in stiff
joints; some of them in deaths. In no case, not even in the case of
death, is a payment demanded. Suppose that in the chase a number of
hunters have surrounded a wild boar. The boar charges one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6071" href="#xd20e6071" name=
"xd20e6071">66</a>]</span>of them. This man leaps backward, and, at the
same time, draws back his spear to throw it at the boar. In so doing,
he stabs a companion behind him with the shod end of the spear handle.
This is not an uncommon accident. The others of the party are witnesses
that the killing was purely accidental (<i lang="ifu">naloktat</i>). No
fine is assessed; but the killer, to show that he is sorry, usually
assists in the funeral feast. Of course, if there were no witnesses,
and if there were a possible motive to complicate matters, the ending
of the case might not be so happy.</p>
<p>Suppose that a number of men are throwing at a target with their
spears. A child runs in the way, and is killed. One-half the usual fine
for manslaughter is assessed on the ground that the thrower was
careless in that he did not make sure before he threw the spear that
such an accident could not occur. In this case there was an absence of
intent; but carelessness was present.</p>
<p>A man kills a neighbor at night, acting under the impression that he
is killing an enemy seeking his life. He is subjected to a much heavier
fine than if he had killed him through carelessness, since there is
present both the intent to kill, although not criminal, and
carelessness in that he did not make sure at whom he was casting his
spear.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6080src" href="#xd20e6080" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Other Factors Affecting Liability</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s85" class="first">85. <i>Alienship.</i>&mdash;If the culprit be
of a foreign village, the fact that he is a foreigner is a strong
aggravating circumstance. If found <i lang="la">in delicto</i>, he is
almost sure to be killed, in cases of theft or the more serious crimes.
In such crimes as insult, the same fine might be demanded of the
foreigner as of a co-villager, but not so much effort would be made to
arrange matters peaceably. If the fine demanded be not paid and paid
quickly, a kidnapping would ensue, or the culprit would be killed. A
man committing a minor crime in a foreign village if not killed would
be caught, tied, and held prisoner until redeemed.</p>
<p id="s86">86. <i>Confession.</i>&mdash;Confession before steps have
been taken to inflict punishment alleviates to a considerable degree
except in murder and adultery. In the latter case, if the adulterer
made a voluntary confession of guilt to the offended spouse, without
having been confronted with the evidence, it would be taken as brazen
boasting, and of the nature of an insult. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e6102" href="#xd20e6102" name="xd20e6102">67</a>]</span></p>
<p id="s87">87. <i>Kinship.</i>&mdash;Kinship is so strong a mitigating
circumstance as often to excuse crime altogether. It has already been
stated that crimes of one brother or sister against another are not
punished. Inasmuch as all procedure is conducted by and between
families, and since the family of the two brothers is identical,
procedure in such cases is impossible. In the case of relatives of
remoter degree, kinship is a strong extenuating circumstance in the
event of the more serious crimes. In minor crimes, while the usual
amount of the fine might be demanded, it would very frequently not be
collected; especially, if the offender were very poor.</p>
<p>It has previously been said that the family is the only
organization, political or social, that the Ifugao has, and that, in
proportion as it is precious and necessary to him, he cherishes it;
that Ifugao law, consequently looks with the greatest disfavor upon
anything that would divide a family or destroy its unity.</p>
<p>In case a man steals from his cousin, who is married, restitution is
usually demanded, together with half the usual fine, which half goes to
the cousin&rsquo;s spouse&mdash;not to himself. Insults on the part of
one cousin to another are rare and are more rarely prosecuted.</p>
<p id="s88">88. <i>Rank and standing in the community.</i>&mdash;This
is probably the greatest single factor in determining the severity of
punishment in cases where a crime is punishable by fine. But the
aggressiveness and the war footing of the two parties to the
controversy enter even here to an astounding degree.</p>
<p>In the Kiangan-Maggok area, there are three grades of
fines&mdash;the highest for the punishment of crimes of one <i lang=
"ifu">kadangyang</i> or rich man, against another; a medium grade for
crimes of persons of the <i lang="ifu">tumok</i>, or middle class,
against each other; and a third and lowest grade for the <i lang=
"ifu">nawatwat</i>, the poverty stricken.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6128src" href="#xd20e6128" name="xd20e6128src">2</a> Each lower
grade of fine is a little more than half the next higher one.</p>
<p>In the Kababuyan area, there are five grades of fines&mdash;one for
the very rich, one for the fairly rich, one for the middle class, one
for the poor, one for the poverty stricken. In Sapao and in Asin, there
are four grades.</p>
<p>So long as both offender and offended are of the same class, there
is no trouble about determining the fine proper in a given case. But
when they are of different classes, the case is not so simple, and the
factors of fighting strength and personality enter. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6143" href="#xd20e6143" name=
"xd20e6143">68</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Suppose that R, a rich man, commits adultery against
P, a poor man. P sends a go-between to demand the highest grade of fine
for this crime&mdash;that is, the grade which <i lang=
"ifu">kadangyang</i> pay. R does not deny the crime, but states that he
considers the payment of the fine that is due one rich man from another
preposterous. He states that he is willing to pay the fine proper to
the poorer class. To this P replies that he did not begin this action
for the purpose of getting money, but for the purpose of so punishing R
as to make a repetition of the crime improbable. There are three
possible endings in such a case:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) P&rsquo;s kin represent to him that they cannot afford to
have war with R; that R&rsquo;s people hold a lot of debts over their
heads; that should R prove obdurate, and should the affair end in a
lance throwing, R&rsquo;s people would wipe them off the earth. They
advise P to be satisfied with the lowest grade of fine. He agrees.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) P and R compromise on the grade of fine that is midway
between their stations; that is, the fine of the middle class. In
Kiangan this is the usual settlement.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) P shows such <i lang="ifu">bungot</i> (wrath and
ferocity) that R&rsquo;s kin advise him to pay the larger fine. They
point out that the fine is a small matter as compared with the loss of
life, and state that there is no telling what this poverty-stricken but
rampant dog will do. This settlement is not uncommon in the Kiangan
area, where the poor people have a great deal of pride and bravery, but
rare in other parts of Ifugao.</p>
<p>Aside from other matters, the diplomacy and tact of the go-between
would have a great deal to do toward determining which of these
contingencies would result.</p>
</div>
<p>It is extremely hard to make a general statement as to fines when
offender and offended are of different classes. It may safely be said
that the fines assessed average the amount midway between the fines
proper to the two classes concerned. Thus, when a poor man offends a
rich man, and when a rich man offends a poor man, the average of the
fines assessed equals approximately the fine assessed for injuries
within the middle class. In questions in which rich and middle class
persons are involved, the fines approximate an amount half way between
the fines of the rich and of the middle classes.</p>
<p id="s89">89. <i>Importance of influential position and
personality.</i>&mdash;The fact has already been mentioned (see
<a href="#s4">sec. 4</a>) that Ifugao administration of justice is
remarkably personal in nature. We have just seen, in the example given
in section 88, to what an extent personality and war-footing enter into
the infliction of fines when offender and offended are of different
classes. Nowhere can a man of magnetism and force reap greater benefit
from these qualities, relatively speaking, than in an Ifugao
controversy. The fact stares us in the face in every phase of Ifugao
law, especially in procedure.</p>
<p id="s89a">89<i>a</i>. <i>Cripples and
unfortunates.</i>&mdash;Cripples and those afflicted by disfigurements
or disfiguring diseases are often in a desperate mood for the reason
that life is not at all precious to them. They are likely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6190" href="#xd20e6190" name=
"xd20e6190">69</a>]</span>to be erratic and to constitute exceptions in
punishment of crimes and procedure. I remember a case that happened in
Baay District a few years ago which illustrates to what extent
determination and absolute abandon to a single purpose are valuable in
carrying a point in Ifugao procedure. I did not make note of the names
but shall designate the rich man as R and the poor man as P. P was
afflicted with the disease <i lang="ifu">hiphip</i>&mdash;probably
ichthyosis&mdash;a skin disease in which the skin becomes white, rough,
and scaly. R met P one day and sneered at him, saying, &ldquo;Although
you have neither fields, gongs, nor jewelry, I see that you have become
a <i lang="ifu">kadongyang</i>, for you are wearing a white coat&rdquo;
(referring to the skin disease). P became violently angry but
restrained himself from assaulting R. He calmly informed R that for
this insult he fined him a large and valuable field, R&rsquo;s property
in Dayukong; that life meant little to himself, and that if R resisted
and interfered with his taking possession of the field, he would
certainly kill him. P further stated that he knew that R&rsquo;s kin
would retaliate and that he would lose his own life but that he did not
care since he was miserable anyway. None of the women would deign him
their favors and being poor&mdash;well, what was the use of living! P
carried his point and maintains possession of the field to this day.
Having the field, he managed to get a wife, who, although homely, has
borne him two or three children who are not afflicted with his
disease.</p>
<p>Another case in point is the following: Piklud, a fairly wealthy man
of Kurug, was paralyzed from the knees down and in his locomotion he
had to crawl on all fours. He loaned a neighbor a chicken. There was a
quarrel over the repayment of this which left ill feeling between the
two. A little while after the quarrel, the neighbor met Piklud crawling
along the path through the village, and called to him as to a dog,
&ldquo;Doa! doa! d&eacute;-d&eacute;-d&eacute;!&rdquo; Piklud pretended
not to notice and even feigned amiability. He gossiped a little about
the drought which was parching the rice fields. Finally he said,
&ldquo;Let me see your spear.&rdquo; He felt the edge and then with the
words, &ldquo;It is pretty sharp, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he thrust it
upward into the other&rsquo;s abdomen.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Principal Crimes and their Frequency</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s90" class="first">90. <i>List of offenses.</i>&mdash;In the
Kiangan-Nagakaran-Maggok area, the principal crimes, in order of their
probable frequency, are: sorcery; adultery; theft; murder (or in the
case of women and children, kidnapping); the putting of an innocent
person in the position of being considered an accessory to crime;
manslaughter; rape of a married woman; arson; incest. Minor crimes are:
insult; slander; false accusation; rape of a girl. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Sorcery</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s91" class="first">91. <i>The ayak</i> (soul-stealing) is a
series of religious ceremonies in which the sorcerer calls to a feast
the ancestral spirits of some man whose death he desires to encompass,
together with many maleficent spirits and deities, and bribes them to
bring to him, incarnated as a blue-bottle fly, a dragon fly, or a bee,
the soul of the man whose death he desires. When one of the insects
mentioned comes to drink of the rice wine in front of the sorcerer, it
is imprisoned and put into a bamboo joint tightly corked. The enemy,
being thus deprived of his soul, will die.</p>
<p>This form of sorcery cannot be practiced unless the sorcerer knows
the names of the ancestral spirits of his victim-to-be. For this
reason, when the Lamot people, who are famous sorcerers, come to
Kiangan and approach a religious feast, the Kiangan people do not
invoke their ancestral spirits until after the visitors have gone.
Needless to say, sorcery is always practiced in secret. It sometimes
happens that it is practiced by a man against his kin. In such a case,
kinship does not extenuate his punishment, since the preservation of
the family necessitates the extirpation of the sorcerer within its
gates. This is the only exception I know of to the general rule that a
family may not proceed against one of its members.</p>
<p id="s92">92. <i>Other forms of sorcery.</i>&mdash;Certain persons
have an evil &ldquo;cut&rdquo; of the eye, which, whether they wish it
or not, brings misfortune or sickness on whomsoever or whatsoever they
see. Injury by means of the &ldquo;evil eye&rdquo; may be effected
intentionally or entirely unintentionally.</p>
<p>The words of certain persons even though innocent and unconnected
with evil, and though spoken as they usually are without malicious
intent, have the quality of bringing whatever is spoken to an evil
end.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Thus A, afflicted with the &ldquo;blasting
word,&rdquo; goes to the house of B, and, seeing a sow with a litter of
handsome pigs, remarks, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine litter of pigs you
have!&rdquo; If A be truly afflicted with the blasting word, the pigs
will die, even though A was without intent to do injury, and was even
ignorant of his affliction.</p>
</div>
<p>The evil eye and the blasting word are frequent
afflictions&mdash;afflictions that their possessor is the last to learn
about. They may be cured by the possessor&rsquo;s offering sacrifices
of the proper sort. In the event of injury unintentionally being done
by evil eye or blasting word, no punishment is meted out, although in
some cases restitution is demanded. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e6232" href="#xd20e6232" name="xd20e6232">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Curses are of two kinds: directly by word, and indirectly by curses
laid on food, drink, or betels. Kiangan people are afraid to purchase
rice from the Lamot people to the south of them through fear of being
affected by curses that may have been laid on the rice.</p>
<p id="s93">93. <i>Punishment of sorcery.</i>&mdash;Sorcerers are not
punished hysterically. To his credit, it must be said that the Ifugao
proceeds slowly in condemning a person for this crime. Before he takes
action, he demands not merely strong grounds for suspicion, but proof
beyond a reasonable doubt that the suspected person is a sorcerer.
Proof that one has performed the <i lang="ifu">ayak</i> ceremony
against a person is sufficient ground for the infliction of the death
penalty. But in the case of the evil eye and the blasting word, it must
be proved that the death of the pigs, the betel vine, or whatever it be
that dies, was due to the glance or words of the bewitched, and that
both glance and words were used with evil intent. This would obviously
be hard to do; but for the purpose of justifying an injured person in
killing such a sorcerer or bewitched one, a record of previous misdeeds
of the kind, and a general conviction, in which a portion, at least, of
the man&rsquo;s kin concurred, that the suspect was a malicious
sorcerer, would be sufficient.</p>
<p>A curse, by one who has no reputation for supernatural powers, is
punishable by the following fine:</p>

<p>A curse by one who had a reputation of being a sorcerer might
possibly lead to the death of the sorcerer on the spot. In case he were
not killed, and the person or thing cursed died, the death penalty
would be inflicted later.</p>
<p>The following instances will be of value as illustrations. Some are
recent, others historical: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6481"

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Before the coming of the Spaniards, Atiwan of Longa
acquired a reputation as a sorcerer. He killed several of his kinsmen
in Baay. Even his relatives in Longa admitted that he was a sorcerer,
and said that he ought to be killed. Ginnid of Baay and several
companions went to Longa one night, and called to Atiwan that they had
come to see him. He opened the house and put down the ladder. The party
ascended, and set upon Atiwan with their war knives and killed him. In
trying to protect him, his wife, Dinaon, was wounded. The killing was
universally approved.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Kimudwe (alias Dulnuan) of Tupplak is a famous, or rather an
infamous, sorcerer. Owing to a quarrel with one of his nephews,
Butlong, over a debt, he performed an <i lang="ifu">ayak</i> to cause
the latter&rsquo;s death. Butlong was informed of the fact by one who,
eavesdropping below Kimudwe&rsquo;s house, heard the prayers and
incantations. On a certain day on which there was a feast in Ambabag,
to which Kimudwe was nearly certain to come, Butlong waylaid him,
firing a rifle at him from cover near Ambabag. His marksmanship was
atrocious. Before he could reload women rushed out from the village and
covered Kimudwe with their bodies, interceding, and stating that there
was not sufficient certainty that Kimudwe was guilty to justify his
nephew in killing him. (This occurred in the interval between Spanish
and American rule.)</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Kimudwe is reputed to have killed by means of sorcery several of his
kinsmen. Recently a child died in Tupplak whose death was attributed to
him. He killed, it is said, the son of Bahni, another of his nephews.
Bahni sent Dulinayan of Ambabag as a go-between to Kimudwe to challenge
him to an ordeal, saying that he had no intention of killing him, even
if guilty, owing to the peculiar prejudice of the Americans against
such doings, but for his own satisfaction he wanted to know if Kimudwe
were the sorcerer. He stated that in case Kimudwe won in the ordeal, he
(Bahni) would pay a fine of a gold bead for having accused him falsely.
This was an unusually large fine. Kimudwe refused, or rather evaded,
saying: &ldquo;If I am a sorcerer, it is a case of the entire family,
including Bahni, being guilty.&rdquo; In other words, he took refuge
behind the Ifugao doctrine of collective responsibility (see <a href=
"#s4">sec. 4</a>).</p>
</div>
<p>In cases of strong suspicion, a supposed sorcerer was often openly
accused and challenged to an ordeal. The ordeal was usually more in the
nature of a duel, the two exchanging spears at twenty steps (20 meters)
distance. If the ordeal showed the suspect guilty, he was killed if he
stayed in the region. He was not, however, killed on the field of
duel&mdash;unless killed in the duel or ordeal itself&mdash;because
such an execution might precipitate a battle with this kin.</p>

<h3 class="main">Adultery</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s94" class="first">94. <i>Forms of adultery.</i>&mdash;In its
unaggravated form, adultery is called <i lang="ifu">luktap</i>.
<i lang="ifu">Luktap</i> signifies sexual intercourse between a spouse
and some person other than the one to whom he (or she) be married,
uncomplicated by insults and scandalous behavior flaunted in the face
of the injured spouse. The intention to abandon the spouse is either
not present, or is concealed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6517"
href="#xd20e6517" name="xd20e6517">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>The aggravated form of adultery is called <i lang="ifu">hokwit</i>.
It consists of openly and scandalously bestowing one&rsquo;s love and
body upon some other person than the spouse; of insulting the injured
spouse; or of repeatedly, while living under the same roof with the
spouse, meeting the third person and having sexual intercourse. The
intention is present of separating (or effecting a separation) from the
injured spouse. The following is an illustration:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Maxima, a girl of Umbul, was married to Ananayo of
Pindungan. But Ananayo had not yet reached the age of puberty, while
Maxima herself had reached that age. Sergeant Dominong, of the
constabulary company at Kiangan, began paying attentions to Maxima,
while Maxima was living in the house of Ananayo &rsquo;s father. During
the season of watching the rice fields against theft of water these two
continually cohabited, the sergeant going to where Maxima was watching
the fields at night. Ananayo attaining the age of puberty in the
meantime, Maxima refused to have anything to do with him. Both Maxima
and Dominong were guilty of <i lang="ifu">hokwit</i> in this case.
Maxima&rsquo;s conduct was considered especially reprehensible, since
she was a <i lang="ifu">binawit</i> in the house of Ananayo &rsquo;s
father (see <a href="#s14">sec. 14</a>).</p>
</div>
<p id="s95">95. <i>Punishment of adultery.</i>&mdash;In both <i lang=
"ifu">luktap</i> and <i lang="ifu">hokwit</i>, the offending spouse and
the lover (or mistress) are equally guilty. Each is equally liable to
punishment. However, the offended spouse may, if he chooses, forgive
the offending spouse without forgiving the partner in crime. This
frequently happens. A wife is more likely to forgive than is a
husband.</p>
<p>The adulterer when taken <i lang="la">in delicto</i> is sometimes
punished by death. The offended spouse is justified by public opinion
in administering this punishment to a considerably greater degree than
our laws in the United States would justify him. Several stories are
told of persons caught in the commission of this crime who were impaled
by a single spear thrust. It should be stated that the kin of those
killed for this crime rarely look upon the killing as justified, and
often avenge it. They take the stand that the offended spouse ought to
have demanded the usual fine; that if this had not been immediately
forthcoming no one would have questioned the propriety of the killing.
On the other hand, the kin of the offended spouse take the ground, and
it may be said that in general public opinion backs them in it that a
self-respecting man could not well do otherwise than kill the offender,
and that the holding off and demanding money would savor too much of
the mercenary.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that a sexual offense committed after the <i lang=
"ifu">mommon</i> ceremony is punished by a small fine; that an offense
committed after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6557" href=
"#xd20e6557" name="xd20e6557">74</a>]</span>the <i lang=
"ifu">imbango</i> or <i lang="ifu">hingot</i> ceremonies is punished by
a larger fine, and that an offense committed after the <i lang=
"ifu">bubun</i> ceremony is punished by what to the Ifugao is a very
large fine. These fines are diagramed Ifugao fashion in <a href=
"#s75">sec. 75</a>. <i lang="ifu">Hokwit</i>, aggravated adultery, is
punished by twice the greatest fine demanded in the case of simple
adultery, <i lang="ifu">luktap</i>.</p>
<p>Adultery being a very hard crime to prove, the Ifugao takes as
proof: (1) the confession of either party; (2) evidence that the
accused wilfully and intentionally placed themselves in such a position
or circumstances that the crime would be presumed by any reasonable
person to have been consummated. Thus, the sleeping of the accused
together at night in the absence of the spouse would be sufficient
evidence.</p>
<p>Both offenders must pay the fine demanded by the circumstances to
the offended party or parties. Thus, if both the offenders be married,
each must pay a fine to (<i>a</i>) his own offended spouse, and
(<i>b</i>) to the offended spouse of the partner in the crime. The
<i>pu-u</i> of the fine goes to the offended spouse&mdash;the rest to
the kin of the offended spouse. In addition to paying the fine, should
the offender desire to continue the marriage relation with his offended
spouse, he must provide animals and other perquisites for a
<i>honga</i> (general welfare feast) in which the kin of both parties
take part, and which is supposed to start the spouses anew in domestic
harmony and felicity, and in all that the Ifugao considers prosperity,
namely, abundance of pigs, chickens, rice, and children.</p>
<p id="s96">96. <i>Sex in relation to punishment for
adultery.</i>&mdash;Although the punishment for adultery is the same
for either sex, the likelihood of the adulterer&rsquo;s being punished
is much greater if the offender be a woman than if he be a man. This is
for the reason that men are more jealous than women and less attached
to their spouses, usually. A great deal of adultery on the part of men
goes unpunished. Most women would rather not hear about the peccadillos
of their husbands. They do not want to take action unless it be forced
upon them. But once the matter is brought to their &ldquo;official
attention,&rdquo; they have to take action in order to &ldquo;save
face.&rdquo; Women sometimes tell their husbands &ldquo;It would be all
right for you to have a mistress if you could only do so without my
hearing of it.&rdquo; And when they learn of some such offense on the
part of their husbands, they sometimes upbraid them, saying: &ldquo;Oh,
why didn&rsquo;t you do this thing in such a way that I would not hear
of it?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6599" href=
"#xd20e6599" name="xd20e6599">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>The husband, on the other hand, usually punishes, and often divorces
his offending wife.</p>
<p>Once an offense is known, it <i>must</i> be acted on. Otherwise, the
offended spouse is considered to be lacking in self respect. And indeed
I believe that the insult involved in adultery is more serious than any
other phase of the crime. The Malay&rsquo;s &ldquo;face&rdquo; is
exceedingly dear to him.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Taking of Life</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s97" class="first">97. <i>General considerations.</i>&mdash;It
is extremely difficult to unravel the law, if there be a law, with
respect to murder, executions, and war. The Ifugao has no tribunals to
sentence, and no government to execute. He makes no declarations of
war. Doubtless no two nations or tribes of the world ever engaged in a
warfare in which each did not consider the other the aggressor, or at
least, the offender. The same is true with respect to feuds between
families, which were almost as numerous as the families themselves. In
spite of the years of American occupation during which comparative
peace has prevailed, these feuds still exist. We must substitute,
however, for patriotism, fraternal and filial love; the sense of duty
to the unavenged dead, love of vengeance, and intense hatred engendered
and justified by a well learned catalogue of wrongs and assassinations
inflicted on the family by the enemy family. Once started, a blood feud
was well nigh eternal (unless ended by a fusion of the families by
means of marriage), for the reason that what was a righteous execution
to one family was a murder (usually treacherous) to the other.</p>
<p>Outside of manslaughter, to be treated of later, it may be stated as
a general tenet of Ifugao practice that the taking of a life must be
paid by a life. Considering, too, that a member of an Ifugao family
rarely if ever effected or accomplished any except the most ordinary
and elemental acts without previous consultation with his family, and
that nearly all killings were effected pursuant to a decision of a
family council, it was not without a fair show of reason that Ifugao
law held that a murder might be punished almost as well by the
execution of some member of the murderer&rsquo;s family as by the
execution of the murderer himself. For, if not principals in the
commission of the crime, other members of the family were at least
accomplices or accessories. Indeed Ifugao law held the whole family
guilty, looking upon the crime, quite correctly, as an offense for
which the whole family was responsible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e6617" href="#xd20e6617" name="xd20e6617">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>War, murder, and the death penalty exacted in execution of justice,
in the Ifugao&rsquo;s society are so near each other as to be almost
synonymous terms. We have already seen that a capital execution for
crime is nearly always looked upon by the kin of the executed as being
a murder; it is retaliated by them, by what to them is a justifiable
execution; but by what, to the killers, is considered as a murder to be
punished by another execution, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
<p>The Ifugao has one general law, which with a few notable exceptions
he applies to killings, be they killings in war, murders, or
executions, which public opinion would pronounce justifiable and legal.
That law is: <i>A life must be paid by a life</i>. Let us pass now to a
consideration of various classes of the takings of human life.</p>
<p id="s98">98. <i>Executions justifiable by Ifugao
law.</i>&mdash;Public opinion or custom, or both, justify the taking of
a life in punishment for the following crimes: sorcery; murder;
persistent and wilful refusal to pay a debt when there is the ability
to pay; adultery discovered <i>in flagrante</i>; theft by one of a
foreign district; refusal to pay a fine assessed for crime or for
injury suffered. But even though custom and public opinion justify the
administration of the extreme penalty in these cases, the kin of the
murdered man do not, in most cases, consider the killing justified.
There are innumerable circumstances that complicate a given case. Was
the sorcery proven or only suspected? Was it a murder that the man
committed; or was he justified in the killing? Would not the debtor
have come to his right mind had his creditor waited a little longer;
and did the creditor approach him in the right way with reference to
the debt? Did not the woman make advances in the adultery case that no
self-respecting male could turn down? Was not the indemnity assessed
too large or otherwise improper; or did the injured party wait long
enough for the payment? These and a thousand other questions may arise
with respect to the various cases.</p>
<p>If the death penalty be inflicted by persons of a foreign district,
it is sure to be looked upon as a murder.</p>
<p>At feasts and gatherings about the &ldquo;bowl that cheers&rdquo;
and especially in drunken brawls, an unavenged killing, no matter what
the circumstances, is likely to be brought up as a reflection upon the
bravery or manhood of the living kin, and so urge them to the avenging
of what was really a justified execution.</p>
<p>Murder, sorcery, and a refusal to pay the fine for adultery justify
the infliction of the death penalty even on a kinsman if he is not too
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6642" href="#xd20e6642" name=
"xd20e6642">77</a>]</span>close a relative. An execution of one kinsman
by another is not so likely to be avenged as is justifiable execution
by one outside the family. This is in accordance with the principle of
Ifugao law: <i>The family must at all hazards be preserved</i>.</p>
<p id="s99">99. <i>Feuds.</i>&mdash;A feud is a series of takings of
human life as vengeance, in which the heads may or may not be taken.
There are some hundreds of ways in which feuds may start. As a rule
they begin with a taking of life that is not justified in the eyes of
the kin of him whose life was taken. They may begin from a retaliation
for a kidnapping or even from an accidental killing. Feuds exist
between neighboring districts, or districts not far distant between
which to a certain extent ties of blood and marriage exist. It is
exceedingly rare&mdash;if it ever occurs&mdash;that entire villages or
districts are involved. The feud is an affair between families only. It
consists of a series of vengeances and &ldquo;returning of
vengeances.&rdquo; Feuds may even start within the district: but as a
rule, they are short lived, being stopped by the counsel of the
influential. Feuds between districts are well nigh interminable
usually, but may come to an end by means of intermarriage or when one
or two of the leaders of each family are afflicted by certain
diseases<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6652src" href="#xd20e6652" name=
"xd20e6652src">3</a> thought to be inflicted by certain deities that
desire the peace ceremony. As has been hitherto stated, each killing in
a feud is considered by the killers to be an entirely justifiable
execution in punishment of crime. The deities of war and justice are
called to witness that the debt is not yet paid. Contemporaneously, the
kin of the slain are calling on the same deities to witness that their
family is sorely afflicted; that no debt was owed the others; that no
chickens or pigs, or rice had been borrowed; that no theft or other
crime had been committed, and so on; yet, that innocent, they are being
slaughtered.</p>
<p id="s100">100. <i>War.</i>&mdash;Before the American occupation,
districts that were far distant might be said to be continually at war
with each other. The war was carried on as a series of head-takings.
There was no formal declaration of war. As a rule there were no large
expeditions to the enemy country, and heads were taken from ambush, on
the outskirts of an enemy village or along much traveled paths.
Women&rsquo;s heads were taken in these exploits; but not as a rule, in
feuds. To avenge lives taken in war, while no doubt the life of the
actual head-taker was preferable, the life of any person of the enemy
village might be taken; just as in feuds, the life of any member of the
enemy family might be taken. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6663"
href="#xd20e6663" name="xd20e6663">78</a>]</span></p>
<p id="s101">101. <i>Head-taking.</i>&mdash;Heads were not taken in the
case of executions for injury. In feuds within a district, heads were
not taken. In feuds between families of different districts, heads
might or might not be taken. Usually they were taken if there were no
ties of kinship between the districts. It should be emphasized,
however, that there was no definite boundary between districts, and
consequently, no well-defined line beyond which heads might be taken.
Families from the southern part of a district would take heads in
territory from which those in the northern part of the district would
not take them. Heads were always taken in the case of those killed in
war, if circumstances permitted.</p>
<p id="s102">102. <i>Hibul or homicide.</i>&mdash;The Ifugao law
clearly recognizes several grades of homicide.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">(<i>a</i>) The taking of life when there is an entire
absence of both intent and carelessness. As for example, in the case
already cited (see <a href="#s54">sec. 54</a>). when a party of hunters
have a wild boar at bay. The boar, as there stated, charges the most
advanced of the hunters, and in retreating backwards, the latter jabs
one of his companions with the shod point of his spear handle. There is
no penalty for such a taking of life.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The taking of life when there is clearly an absence of
intent, but a degree of carelessness. For example, a number of men are
throwing spears at a mark. A child runs in the way, and is killed. The
penalty is a fine varying from one third to two thirds the amount of
the full fine for homicide according to the decree of carelessness.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Intentional taking of the life of another, under the
impression that he is an enemy when in reality he is a co-villager or a
companion. In case the killer can make the family of the slain
understand the circumstances, only a fine is assessed. This fine is
called <i>labod</i>. (See <a href="#s106">sec. 106</a>.) If the killer
be unrelated to the slain, the full amount of the <i>labod</i> is
demanded: if related, the amount is usually lessened.</p>
<p>Example: Pumauwat of Raay was irrigating his fields at night. Some
of his companions told him that there were some head-hunters from an
enemy village near. In the darkness. Pumauwat encountered another man.
Likyayu, the betrothed of his daughter. He asked him who was there. On
account of the noise of water falling from the rice fields, Likyayu did
not hear the inquiry, and said nothing. Pumauwat speared him. Likyayu
cried out. Pumauwat recognized his voice, and carried him home. He
furnished animals for sacrifice to secure Likyayu&rsquo;s recovery.
Likyayu recovered. Had he died, Pumauwat would have been called on for
the full amount of the fine: but had Likyayu been <i>firmly</i> engaged
to Pumauwat&rsquo;s daughter, that is, had the <i>bango</i> ceremony
been performed the full amount of the <i>labod</i> fine would not have
been demanded, since the relationship would have been an extenuating
circumstance.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The taking of life by persons in a brawl or by an
intoxicated or insane person. In case the slain died before his slayer
could agree to provide animals for sacrifice, the latter would probably
be killed by the kin of the slain if he were of a foreign district. He
might be killed if a non-related co-villager. He would be fined the
<i>labod</i> if a kinsman. He would probably go scot free if a brother
or uncle.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6723" href="#xd20e6723" name=
"xd20e6723">79</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Example: A of Longa became insanely drunk at a feast
at the house of his brother Gimbungan. He attempted to embrace the
comely daughter of Gimbungan, his niece. Gimbungan tried to quiet him,
and in so doing aroused his ire. He drew back his spear menacingly, and
in so doing pierced the girl&mdash;who was at his back&mdash;with the
shod point at the end. She died. A was properly penitent when he
sobered, and furnished animals for sacrifice. The fine <i>labod</i> was
not, however, demanded of him. This was about thirty five or forty
years ago. Considerable feeling exists between the two branches of the
family to this day, owing to this occurrence.</p>
</div>
<p>The burden rests upon the slayer in the above cases to show that the
killing was accidental or that he was so drunk as to have utterly lost
his reason. The absence of a motive is a great help to him in this. If
he has ever had a serious altercation with the slain, in the absence of
controverting evidence, the presumption is likely to be that the
killing was intentional, and that he has been &ldquo;feigning
friendship in order to kill by <i>ug&acirc;</i> (treachery).&rdquo;</p>
<p id="s103">103. <i>Attempts to murder.</i>&mdash;An attempt on the
part of an enemy of another district on the life of a person is
punishable by death. An attempt by one of the same district may or may
not be punished by death; in most cases peace would be arranged by
mutual friends and kinsmen. In such a case, he who made the attempt
would be required to furnish animals for a peace feast.</p>
<p id="s104">104. <i>Wounding</i>.&mdash;Wounds inflicted accidentally
and without intent or carelessness are not punished. In case the
element of intent or carelessness be present, he who inflicts the
wounds must furnish animals for sacrifice, pay the wounded man and his
kin a fine, and stand the expense of a feast to make peace. The
following is a typical list, for the <i>kadangyang</i> (wealthy)class,
of the expenses of animals for sacrifice and fine:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">(<i>a</i>) First feast for the recovery of the wounded
man, sacrifices to the war deities: 3 pigs at 15 pesos; 10 chickens at
1 peso; total 55 pesos.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Second feast for recovery, the <i>pinochla</i>, or feast
to cure wounds and infections: 1 pig at 10 pesos; 2 chickens at 1 peso;
8 spear heads as fees of priests at 25c; total 14 pesos.</p>
</div>
<p>In case the wounded man lives, the following fine is paid him and
his kin:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">(<i>c</i>) Fine of two <i>bakid</i> (two tens)
amounting to 72 pesos; fee of the <i>monkalan</i>, 10 pesos; total 82
pesos.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Peace making ceremony: 1 pig at 15 pesos; other
appurtenances of feast, 2 pesos; total 17 pesos.</p>
</div>
<p id="s105">105. <i>Special liability of the givers of certain
feasts.</i>&mdash;The givers of <i>uyauwe</i> or <i>hagabi</i> feasts
(glorified general welfare feasts to which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6795" href="#xd20e6795" name=
"xd20e6795">80</a>]</span>great numbers of people come) are responsible
for wounds or deaths that occur at these feasts. When a man decides to
initiate himself and his wife into the ranks of the <i>kadangyang</i>
by giving one of these feasts, he appoints one of the old priests of
his family to perform the <i>tikman</i> ceremonies. These ceremonies
are sacrifices to the various classes of deities whose special function
is the &ldquo;tying up&rdquo; of men&rsquo;s stomachs and passions.
Prayers are addressed to these deities that a little food satisfy the
guest that attends the feast, to the end that the giver be not eaten
out of house and home; that a little rice wine suffice to intoxicate
the people; that the passions of men be tied up to the end that no
quarrels or frays occur; that no rice-wine jars or gongs be broken;
that no accidents occur&mdash;in short, that the whole feast pass off
smoothly. The duties of the <i>manikam</i> (the priest who performs
these ceremonies) are rather arduous. To say nothing of the ceremonies
he conducts, he must fast for a number of days and must observe a
number of taboos. He receives rather a large fee for these services.
And, indeed, their importance, in the eyes of the Ifugaos, and the
legal responsibility he incurs, certainly justify a large fee.</p>
<p>The <i>manikam</i> priests are jointly responsible with the giver of
the feast for accidents or violence that may occur. This liability of
the giver of the feast for wounds or loss of life is based on the
supposition that if he had not given the feast the wound would not have
occurred; and possibly that he gave the feast with the motive of
bringing about such an occurrence. The liability of the <i>manikam</i>
is based on the supposition that there must have been a remissness on
his part in his religious duties, else the accident or loss would never
have occurred. The following is an actual instance that would indicate
that this provision of the law is an incipient employer&rsquo;s
liability provision.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Malingan of Pindungan, many years ago, gathered
together his kin and friends, performed the preliminary feasts, and
went to Payauan to make a <i>hagabi</i> (lounging bench, the insignium
of the <i>kadangyang</i> class). They made a very large <i>hagabi</i>
that weighed nearly a ton. In helping to carry it across the river two
men were carried downstream by the current and drowned. Demand was made
on Malingan and the <i>manikam</i> of the feast for the <i>labod</i>
fine (see <a href="#s106">sec. 106</a>). It was paid, and that is the
reason Malingan&rsquo;s descendants are not wealthier today, for
formerly Malingan was one of the wealthiest men of the district.</p>
</div>
<p>It should be stated that brawls and accidents are much more common
in feasts of this character given in parts of Ifugao other than the
Kiangan-Nagakaran-Maggok area. This is due to the fact that in the area
named above only relatives and persons invited by relatives
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e6840" href="#xd20e6840" name=
"xd20e6840">81</a>]</span>attend, while in other regions the event is
not so exclusive. There is the further consideration that in this area,
on the night before the general drink-fest begins, an old man makes a
speech in which he tries to put the crowd assembled in a good humor,
and in which he warns each and every one to seize and hold any person
who begins to disgrace hospitality by unseemly brawling.</p>
<p id="s106">106. <i>The labod, fine assessed for
homicide.</i>&mdash;This fine is paid to the family of the slain. For
the <i>kadangyang</i>, or wealthy class, the full fine consists of ten
portions or divisions, totaling 975 pesos in the case tabulated below.
These divisions may be briefly described as follows:</p>

</div>
<p>The rank of the slain has something to do with the amount of the
<i lang="ifu">labod</i>. The amounts given above are those that would
be collected in the case of the killing of a Kiangan man of the
<i lang="ifu">kadangyang</i> class. If the slain were a middle class or
poor man the amounts would not be so great.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7121src" href="#xd20e7121" name="xd20e7121src">4</a> If the
slayer were a middle class, or poor man, the amounts above might be
lessened somewhat, but not very much. If the slayer be unable to pay,
he is saddled with the rest as a debt. If he cannot pay the debt during
his lifetime, his children must pay it.</p>
<p id="s107">107. <i>Accidental killing of animals.</i>&mdash;The
accidental killing of an animal is not a crime. Sometimes even the
value of the animal is not demanded or accepted if tendered.</p>
<p>If a dog runs out threatening to bite a passer-by, and the latter
kills it, he is required to pay the value of the dog. If a dog bites a
passer-by, the latter may kill the dog and need not pay a fine. If the
dog bites him, and he does not kill it, he may demand a payment from
the owner. It was a provision of primitive Roman law that &ldquo;If an
injury were done by a slave, the person injured had the right to exact
vengeance against the slave personally, thus injuring the
master&rsquo;s property; and the master or owner was consequently
allowed to prevent this vengeance by making compensation for the injury
done.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7132src" href="#xd20e7132"
name="xd20e7132src">5</a></p>
<p>Should a pig, at that period of the year when rice is stacked below
the granary to dry out, enter through the fence and eat of the rice, it
may be killed by the owner of the granary; but he must give the owner
another pig in place of it. Such a killing is not considered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e7140" href="#xd20e7140" name=
"xd20e7140">83</a>]</span>malicious, for the pig was spoiling the
&ldquo;miraculous increase&rdquo; of the year&rsquo;s harvest.</p>
<p>A pig that enters a rice field and eats of the unharvested rice is
usually returned to the owner with the request that he tie the pig up.
Should it again enter the field, the damage it does must be paid for.
Should the owner refuse to pay this indemnity, and should the pig again
enter the field, the owner of the field would be likely to kill the
animal. The owner of the pig might consider such a killing malicious
and improper. Public opinion would sustain the owner of the field.</p>
<p id="s108">108. <i>Malicious killing of animals.</i>&mdash;This is a
serious crime. Its seriousness is due partly to the fact that domestic
animals are to a great extent considered members of the household and
as such loved and protected, and further to the fact that the
intentional and malicious killing of such a member of a household would
have a tendency to bring a like fate on the human members thereof,
owing to the mystic power and force of analogy.</p>
<p>A <i lang="ifu">labod</i> fine is demanded for the malicious killing
of a pig. The fine, in case a wealthy family is concerned, is as
follows:</p>

another.</i>&mdash;He who, voluntarily or involuntarily, puts another
in the position of an accomplice, or in such a light that he might be
regarded as being an accomplice in the commission of a crime, and so be
liable to punishment as such, must pay the person so injured a fine,
called <i lang="ifu">tokom</i>. It may almost be said that he who
causes another person&rsquo;s name to be prominently mentioned or
bandied in connection with a crime must pay this fine.</p>
<p>The following are instances in which a <i lang="ifu">tokom</i> would
be demanded:</p>
<div class="blockquote">

&ldquo;on record&rdquo; as not having been an accomplice. But he says
nothing about the crime unless it come to light that he was a witness
of it. In this case he proves by the <i lang="ifu">tokom</i> that he
received that he had no connection with it. As a matter of practice it
would seem that a gift received from the thief would tend to lead the
witness to conceal the crime.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>

and alliance be accomplished between Timbuluy and his Maggok visitors
by means of the feast called <i lang="ifu">monbiyao</i>. A day was
appointed for this feast, and Binwag of Bolog was named as the
go-between in matters pertaining to the feast. These preliminaries

were killed by some people from Wingian.</p>
<p>The following persons were under obligation to demand a <i lang=

<p class="first"><i>Kadangyang class</i>: It is a general principle
that true <i lang="ifu">kadangyang</i> do not steal. However, it
sometimes occurs, especially in the Kiangan-Maggok area, that persons
who have the right to claim this rank become needy. The rule for the
punishment of members of this class is: The <i lang=
"ifu">kadangyang</i> must return the stolen thing, or, if it shall have
been consumed, its equivalent in value, and must entirely surround it
with like things of equivalent value. This rule merely amounts to the
paying of five times the value of the stolen thing. He must also pay a
fee to the go-between.</p>
<p><i>Middle class</i>: A thief of this class must return the stolen
thing and <i lang="ifu">ulpitan</i> it, i.e., place a like thing, or an
equivalent value, on either side of it. He must also pay a <i lang=
"ifu">liwa</i> fee to the go-between of the case.</p>
<p><i>Very poor</i>: A thief of this class must repay the stolen
article or its equivalent value, <i lang="ifu">tokopna</i>, and pay a
fee to the go-between in the case.</p>
</div>
<p>In the case of the theft of heirlooms of great value, such as
rice-wine jars, or <i lang="ifu">gansas</i>, the thief must repay,
besides the stolen articles, their <i lang="ifu">tokop</i>, or equal,
and in addition must furnish a certain number of pigs or other articles
of medium value. The following shows how the Ifugao visualizes a
payment of this sort.</p>
<ul>
<li>The stolen article.</li>
<li>Its equal or equivalent.</li>
<li><i>Honga</i>, a full-grown pig.</li>
<li><i>Yubyub</i>, a full-grown chicken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Theft should not be confused with improper or illegal confiscation.
This latter is commonly effected by members of the <i lang=
"ifu">kadangyang</i> class. It is punished in much the same way as
theft, but is not so disgraceful.</p>
<p>A thief discovered <i lang="la">in delicto</i> is likely to be
punished by death if the thief be of a different district. If not
punished by death, the culprit is caught and tied and kept prisoner
until his kin in the other district pay the fine demanded. This fine,
needless to say, is somewhat larger than would ordinarily be assessed
for the crime. If a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e7462" href=
"#xd20e7462" name="xd20e7462">86</a>]</span>member of the home district
be caught in an unaccomplished theft, the case is not altered in any
way from an ordinary, consummated theft.</p>
<p id="s111">111. <i>Theft of rice from a granary.</i>&mdash;The theft
of rice is considerably more serious than would be theft of any other
article of equal value, because it ruins the miraculous increase of the
rice that the Ifugao as well as all other Malay tribes in these islands
so thoroughly believe in. If the thief confesses and shows himself
docile, he may wipe out his guilt with the following payment:</p>
<ul>
<li><i lang="ifu">Hulul-na,</i> 1 large pig, payment of the stolen
rice.</li>
<li><i lang="ifu">Honga</i>, 1 large pig and 1 large chicken, for
granary feast to secure return of the miraculous increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, however, the accused persistently deny his guilt, he is
challenged to an ordeal. If by this he is proven guilty, he is fined
one <i lang="ifu">bakid</i> or one &ldquo;ten&rdquo;&mdash;in Kiangan
about thirty pesos&mdash;in addition to the payment above. If he refuse
to submit to the ordeal, he is adjudged guilty, and has to make the
same payments as if he had submitted to the ordeal and had been
adjudged guilty. The fee of the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> is included
in, and is not additional to, the <i lang="ifu">bakid</i> in this
case.</p>
<p id="s112">112. <i>Theft of unharvested rice.</i>&mdash;In a case of
this sort, the amount of rice stolen can be determined by estimating it
from the number of headless stalks. The punishment is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The return of the stolen rice or its equivalent value.</li>
<li>A full-grown pig for the owner&rsquo;s harvest feast.</li>
<li>The fee for the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="s113">113. <i>Illegal confiscation.</i>&mdash;What the Ifugao
recognizes as legal confiscation is treated below under Procedure,
sections 134 to 138. The following is a case of illegal confiscation in
the district of Banaue.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">A owes B a debt, which he persistently refuses to pay.
Both men are of the <i lang="ifu">Kadangyang</i> class. B is somewhat
afraid of A, or for some reason cannot or does not dare collect the
debt according to the ordinary mode of procedure. He accordingly runs
away with a valuable rice-wine jar belonging to A, <i>leaving nothing
behind to show who took it</i>.</p>
<p>B finds out who ran away with his jar. He pays the debt he owes B,
if it be truly owed, and demands the following from him for his
improper procedure:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The return of the stolen jar.</p>
<p>Another one like it, or an equivalent of some sort.</p>
<p>A gong as a <i lang="ifu">dalag</i> (fine for illegal
confiscation).</p>
<p>A large pig for a <i lang="ifu">honga</i> (general welfare
feast).</p>
<p>A kettle worth five pesos called <i lang="ifu">habale</i> (pegs on
which house charms are hung). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e7542"
href="#xd20e7542" name="xd20e7542">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>4 yards of brass wire. This payment is called <i>nundopa</i>,
referring to the jumping down of the culprit when he carried off the
jar.</p>
<p>Death blanket with which to carry jar home.</p>
</div>
<p>If B, when he ran away with the jar, had left behind his scabbard or
bolo or some other of his belongings to show his identity, the above
would have been a case of legal confiscation, and not punishable.</p>
</div>
<p>Illegal confiscation lacks the elements of disgrace that theft
carries with it, and, in the mind of the confiscator and his relatives
at least, is justifiable. It may be that it is for this very reason
that this crime is punished more severely than ordinary theft.</p>

<p id="s114" class="first">114. <i>Fines assessed for goba or
arson.</i>&mdash;One caught in the act of setting fire to a house or
granary would be likely to be killed on the spot. Should he consummate
the act and escape, demand would probably be made upon him and his kin
for <i>two</i> granaries full of rice and for the animals necessary to
consecrate them by the usual feasts. This would be the <i>probable</i>
punishment. The crime of arson is rare, and consequently there is no
penalty or restitution well defined by law. The punishment might be
death, or the kidnapping and selling into slavery of a member of the
culprit&rsquo;s family, or a fine as above. Which of these it would be
would depend very much on the personality of the injured party.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s115" class="first">115. <i>Circumstances under which kidnapping
may occur.</i>&mdash;If performed to cover a debt for which payment had
been repeatedly demanded, or to cover an injury for which a proper fine
had been repeatedly demanded in due form, kidnapping was a legal
seizure, although the victim and his kindred might not consider it
so.</p>
<p>But there were a good many cases in which the kidnapper&rsquo;s
motive was utterly different. He might wish, for example, to display
his valor, or to profit financially by the sale of his captives.
Sometimes, too, a head-hunting party, failing to get a head, would
capture a woman and carry her back with them to their village. In some
parts of Ifugao the woman was ravished for a period of five days by the
party of head-hunters. She was then sold into slavery.</p>
<p>The penalty inflicted by the kin of the kidnapper was either death
or retaliation by kidnapping. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e7583"

be becoming more frequent, for there has undoubtedly been a growing

<div class="divBody">
<p id="s117" class="first">117. <i>Both parties being
unmarried.</i>&mdash;The unmarried Ifugaos, from earliest childhood,
are accustomed to collect in certain houses, using them as dormitories.
Usually both sexes sleep together in these dormitories. Naturally, too,
there is a great deal of sexual intercourse each night, for sexual
intercourse takes the same place among the Ifugaos that embraces and
kisses do in the courtship of some other peoples. The nature of the
female human being, says the Ifugao, is to resist the advances of the
male. He na&iuml;vely points out that the hens, the cows, and, in fact,
the females of any species resist the male in this respect,
notwithstanding they may be quite as anxious for the sexual act as the
male himself. It is so with women, he says. It is considered shocking
in some sections of Ifugao for a girl to yield herself to her lover the
first time without resistance. This idiosyncracy of feminine nature
being a fact, it is sometimes difficult to be certain as to whether the
resistance offered by a girl is <i>bona fide</i> or not&mdash;as to
whether she is willing for the sexual act to occur, half willing, or
entirely opposed to it. There may or may not be doubt in the mind of
the male&mdash;usually there is none&mdash;but friends of the girl, by
distorting or by putting a slightly different interpretation on what
occurred, could make a case of rape in the white man&rsquo;s courts out
of almost any of these common events. Furthermore, a girl on the advice
of her parents, were such a rape punishable by fine, might and
frequently would, entice some youth into forcing her, in order that her
family might benefit financially.</p>
<p>Consequently if a girl be &ldquo;caught&rdquo; in a sleeping house
by a youth who habitually sleeps there, the Ifugaos do not look upon it
as a case of rape, even though force be used. By following this
principle a great many questions and &ldquo;put-up-jobs&rdquo; are
avoided. If a girl be seized and raped by one who does not habitually
sleep in or frequent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e7605" href=
"#xd20e7605" name="xd20e7605">89</a>]</span>the girl&rsquo;s dormitory,
and the evidence establishes a case of <i>bona fide</i> resistance on
the part of the girl, a fine of &ldquo;six&rdquo; is assessed against
the raptor as follows:</p>

<p>It will be noted that the above are very light fines. In some parts
of Ifugao they would be considerably higher&mdash;notably in the
Silipan country.</p>
<p>The committing of the crime of rape in broad daylight, as, for
example, the &ldquo;catching&rdquo; of a woman in a <i>camote</i>
field, constitutes an aggravating circumstance. Such a rape as that
punishable by a fine of &ldquo;six&rdquo; above would be punishable by
a fine of &ldquo;ten&rdquo; of a value for the three classes
respectively of about thirty-two pesos, sixteen pesos, and eight pesos,
if committed in broad daylight. This is owing to the greater
&ldquo;shame&rdquo; which the woman feels on account of the unwonted
hour.</p>
<p id="s118">118. <i>Rape of a married woman by an unmarried
man.</i>&mdash;This is a serious offense. It is punishable by a fine
equivalent to twice the fine assessed for <i lang="ifu">luktap</i>, or
unaggravated adultery. One-half of this fine goes to the husband of the
outraged woman and his kin and one-half to the woman and her kin.</p>
<p id="s119">119. <i>Rape of a married woman by a married

<p>The amount of the fine depends to a great extent on the seriousness
of the offense of which one is accused.</p>
<p id="s121">121. <i>Baag or slander.</i>&mdash;This offense is
punishable by a somewhat smaller fine than that above. The following is
an instance to illustrate what trivial statements may be considered as
slanders. At an <i lang="ifu">uyauwe</i> feast Bahni of Tupplak made
remarks derogatory to Bumidang of Palao, the principal of which was to
the effect that Bumidang would never have been a <i lang=
"ifu">kadangyang</i> had it not been for the fees that he received from
the Palao people for acting as go-between in buying back the heads of
their slain from their Silepan enemies. Bumidang considered this as
slander, and seized a carabao belonging to Bahni, holding it until
payment of the fine assessed for insult was made.</p>
<p id="s122">122. <i>Threats of violence.</i>&mdash;<i lang=
"ifu">Ongot</i>, or threat, is punished by about the same fine as
slander.</p>
<p id="s123">123. <i>Insult.</i>&mdash;The saying to another person of
anything reflecting on his honor, prestige, or rank; the use of abusive
language to an equal or superior; insinuations as to improper relations
with kinswomen; improper language and behavior in the presence of
people of opposite sexes who are related to each other within the
forbidden degrees; breaking of various taboos&mdash;all of these
constitute insults, and are punishable by a fine varying in size from
the fine for slander to that for false accusation.</p>
<p>There exist a considerable number of taboos, for breaking of which a
penalty is exacted.</p>
<p>First. There are taboos relating to exogamy. In the presence of male
and female kin that are of the degrees within which marriage is
forbidden it is taboo: (<i>a</i>) to look fixedly at the woman&rsquo;s
breasts or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8053" href="#xd20e8053"
name="xd20e8053">91</a>]</span>hips; (<i>b</i>) to speak of the
dormitory of the unmarried; (<i>c</i>) to mention the love affairs of
an unmarried couple except most guardedly; (<i>d</i>)to break wind;
(<i>e</i>) to blackguard; (<i>f</i>) to play the <i lang=
"ifu">bikong</i>, lover&rsquo;s harp. Matters connected with sex must
not be referred to unnecessarily; whenever it is necessary to refer to
them, the most delicately veiled euphemisms must be used. Thus an
unborn babe must be called &ldquo;the friend&rdquo;; the placenta must
be termed a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo;; the short plank that constitutes the
Ifugao&rsquo;s bed must be designated as a &ldquo;level&rdquo;; even an
egg must be referred to as a &ldquo;soft stone&rdquo; or &ldquo;stone
of the chickens.&rdquo; It is a very grave insult, knowing two people
to be of the forbidden degrees of kinship, to ask them if they are
married. Even if asked in ignorance of the kinship, such a question is
considered to show exceeding ill breeding. On my first arrival among
the Ifugaos I was several times made to feel like a boorish lout by
having asked the question of the wrong people. I then hit upon the
scheme of asking two people if they were brother and sister before
asking if they were married. This, however, was equally a <i lang=
"fr">faux pas</i> in case the two were husband and wife, since to the
Ifugao it amounted to asking a man if he had married his sister. I then
learned to do as a well-bred Ifugao does in such cases: to observe and
deduce from the conduct of the two what their relationship might be.
This was never a difficult matter.</p>
<p>Second. Acts which savor of adultery are tabooed. Among such are the
intentional touching of the body of a married woman. If a man meets a
married woman on a rice-field dike, the proper thing for him to do is
to step off into the mud and water and let her pass. He may not grasp
her body in order to squeeze past her and thus avoid stepping into the
water. It is forbidden, too, to enter a house in which a married woman
is alone.</p>
<p>Third. It is taboo, knowing a person to be dead, to ask his sons or
near kin if he is dead.</p>
<p>Fourth. Certain acts are believed to be injurious to others because
they are bad in their magic influence. Thus trying to collect a debt
when a member of the debtor&rsquo;s household is ill is taboo. The
penalty for this act is the loss of the debt, be it large or small. It
is believed that any subtraction from the sick person&rsquo;s or his
family&rsquo;s possessions is bound to react injuriously on his
health.</p>
<p>Passing near or through a field of rice in a foreign district during
harvest is taboo, because it is a disturbing factor and interferes with
the miraculous increase. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8086" href=

<h3 class="main">The Family in Relation to Procedure</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s124" class="first">124. <i>Family unity and
co&ouml;peration.</i>&mdash;The mutual duty of kinsfolk and relatives,
each individual to every other of the same family, regardless of sex,
is to aid, advise, assist, and support in all controversies and
altercations with members of other groups or families. The degree of
obligation of the various members of a family group to assist and back
any particular individual of that group is in direct proportion:
<i>first</i>, to the kinship or the relationship by marriage;
<i>second</i>, to the loyalty the individual in question has himself
manifested toward the family group, that is, the extent to which he
discharges his obligations to that group.</p>
<p>The family is without any political organization whatever. It is a
little democracy in which each member is measured for what he is worth,
and has a voice accordingly in the family policy. It is a different
body for every married individual of the whole Ifugao tribe.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e8106src" href="#xd20e8106" name="xd20e8106src">1</a>
There are a great many relationships that complicate matters. An
Ifugao&rsquo;s family is his nation. The family is an executive and a
judicial body. Its councils are informal, but its decisions are none
the less effective. The following rules and principles apply to the
family and to individuals in the matter of procedure.</p>
<p>Brothers of the blood can never be arrayed against each other. They
may fall out and quarrel, but they can never proceed against each
other. This is for the reason that their family is identical (before
marriage at least), and a family cannot proceed against itself.</p>
<p>Cousins and brothers of the half-blood ought never to be arrayed
against each other in legal procedure. In case they should be so
arrayed, the mutual kin try to arrange peace. Only in the event of
serious injuries may a cousin with good grace and with the approval of
public opinion collect a fine from another cousin, and even then he
should not demand as much as from a non-related person. In the case of
minor injuries he should forego punishing his kindred. The following is
an example: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8113" href="#xd20e8113"
name="xd20e8113">93</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">A steals some rice from his cousin B. Theft and thief
become known. <span class="corr" id="xd20e8117" title=
"Source: A">B</span> takes no steps against the thief; but <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e8120" title="Source: A">B</span>&rsquo;s wife cannot
overlook it&mdash;and the injury was an injury to her as much as to
<span class="corr" id="xd20e8123" title="Source: A">B</span>. Her kin
take the matter up. They collect half the usual indemnity for their
kinswoman. <span class="corr" id="xd20e8126" title="Source: A">B</span>
foregoes his half of the indemnity.</p>
</div>
<p>In cases of minor injury, procedure against more distant kin is
frowned on, but sometimes occurs.</p>
<p>It is the duty of mutual, equally related relatives and kin to try
to arrange peace between opposing kin or relatives.</p>
<p>In the event of procedure on the part of one kinsman against
another, those who are related to both take sides with him to whom they
are more closely related. Besides blood relationship, there is marriage
relationship oftentimes to make it a very complex and difficult problem
for a man to decide to which opponent his obligation binds him. This is
most frequently the case among the remoter kin. A man who finds himself
in such a position, and who knows that on whichever side he may array
himself he will be severely criticized by the other, becomes a strong
advocate of compromise and peaceful settlement.</p>
<p>In case a kinsman to whom one owes loyalty in an altercation is in
the wrong and has a poor case, one may secretly advise him to
compromise; one must never openly advise such a measure. One may
secretly refuse him assistance and backing&mdash;one must never oppose
him.</p>
<p>One owes no obligation in the matter of procedure to another merely
because he is a co-villager or inhabitant of the same district.</p>
<p>The obligation to aid and assist kinsmen beyond the third or fourth
degree is problematic, and a question into which elements of personal
interest enter to a great extent. One of the greatest sources of the
power of the principal <i>kadangyang</i> lies in their ability to
command the aid of their remote kin on account of their prestige and
wealth and ability to dispense aid and favor.</p>
<p>There is also a class, small in number, corresponding somewhat to
the &ldquo;clients&rdquo; of the chiefs of the ancient Gauls. This body
is composed of servants who have grown up in the service and household
of a master, and who have been well treated, and in times of need
sustained and furnished with the things needful to Ifugao welfare;
another division consists of those who habitually borrow or habitually
rent from one who stands in the nature of an overlord to them. This
class is most numerous in districts where most of the lands are in the
hands of a few men. The duty of the clients to their lord and of their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8148" href="#xd20e8148" name=
"xd20e8148">94</a>]</span>lord to them seems to be about the same as
those duties have always been in a feudal society; that is to say, the
duty of rendering mutual aid and assistance.</p>
<p>The first step in any legal procedure is to consult with one&rsquo;s
kin and relatives. In initiating steps to assess a fine or collect an
indemnity, the next step is the selection of a <i lang=
"ifu">monkalun</i>.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Monkalun or Go-between</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s125" class="first">125. <i>Nature of his duties.</i>&mdash;The
office of the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> is the most important one to
be found in Ifugao society. The <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> is a whole
court, completely equipped, in embryo. He is judge, prosecuting and
defending counsel, and the court record.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8169src" href="#xd20e8169" name="xd20e8169src">2</a> His duty and
his interest are for a peaceful settlement. He receives a fee, called
<i lang="ifu">lukba</i> or <i lang="ifu">liwa</i>. To the end of
peaceful settlement he exhausts every art of Ifugao diplomacy. He
wheedles, coaxes, flatters, threatens, drives, scolds, insinuates. He
beats down the demands of the plaintiffs or prosecution, and bolsters
up the proposals of the defendants until a point be reached at which
the two parties may compromise. If the culprit or accused be not
disposed to listen to reason and runs away or &ldquo;shows fight&rdquo;
when approached, the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> waits till the former
ascends into his house, follows him, and, <i>war-knife in hand</i>,
sits in front of him and compels him to listen.</p>
<p>The <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> should not be closely related to
either party in a controversy. He may be a distant relative of either
one of them. The <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> has no authority. All that
he can do is to act as a peace making go-between. His only power is in
his art of persuasion, his tact and his skillful playing on human
emotions and motives. Were he closely related to the plaintiff, he
would have no influence with the defendant, and <i lang="la">mutatis
mutandis</i> the opposite would be true.</p>
<p>Ultimately in any state the last appeal is to a death-dealing
weapon. For example, in our own society a man owes a debt which he does
not pay. Action is brought to sell his property to pay the debt. If he
resists, he is in danger of death at the hands of an agent of the law.
Much more is he in danger if he resists punishment for crime. The same
is true in the Ifugao society. The lance is back of every demand of
importance, and sometimes it seems hungry. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8210" href="#xd20e8210" name=
"xd20e8210">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>An Ifugao&rsquo;s pride as well as his self-interest&mdash;one might
almost say his self-preservation&mdash;demands that he shall collect
debts that are owed him, and that he shall punish injuries or crimes
against himself. Did he not do so he would become the prey of his
fellows. No one would respect him. Let there be but one debt owed him
which he makes no effort to collect; let there be but one insult
offered him that goes unpunished, and in the drunken babbling attendant
on every feast or social occasion, he will hear himself accused of
cowardice and called a woman.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-interest and self-respect demand that the
accused shall not accept punishment too tamely or with undue haste, and
that he shall not pay an exorbitant fine. If he can manage to beat the
demands of the complainant down below those usually met in like cases,
he even gains in prestige. But the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> never
lets him forget that the lance has been scoured and sharpened for him,
and that he walks and lives in daily danger of it.</p>
<p>The accuser is usually not over anxious to kill the accused. Should
he do so, the probabilities are that the kin of the accused would
avenge the death, in which case he, the slayer, would be also slain.
The kin of each party are anxious for a peaceable settlement, if such
can be honorably brought about. They have feuds a-plenty on their hands
already. Neighbors and co-villagers do not want to see their
neighborhood torn by internal dissension and thus weakened as to the
conduct of warfare against enemies. All these forces make for a
peaceful settlement.</p>
<p>It is the part of the accused to dally with danger for a time,
however, and at last to accede to the best terms he can get, if they be
within reason.</p>

<h3 class="main">Testimony</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s126" class="first">126. <i>Litigants do not confront each
other.</i>&mdash;From the time at which a controversy is formally
entered into, the principals and their kin are on a basis of
theoretical&mdash;perhaps I ought to say religious&mdash;enmity. A
great number of taboos keep them apart. Diplomatic relations between
the two parties have been broken off and all business pertaining to the
case is transacted through the third party, the <i lang=
"ifu">monkalun</i>. He hears the testimony that each side brings
forward to support its contention. Through him each controversant is
confronted with the testimony of the other. It is greatly to the
interest of the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> to arrange a peaceful
settlement, not only because he usually receives <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8236" href="#xd20e8236" name=
"xd20e8236">96</a>]</span>a somewhat larger fee in such case, but
because the peaceful settlement of cases in which he is mediator builds
up a reputation for him, so that he is frequently called and so can
earn many fees. To the end of arranging this peaceful settlement, the
<i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> reports to each party to the controversy the
strong points of the testimony in favor of the other party, and
oftentimes neglects the weaknesses.</p>
<p>There are no oaths or formalities in the giving of testimony.</p>

<div id="ch5.4" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ordeals</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s127" class="first">127. <i>Cases in which
employed.</i>&mdash;In criminal cases in which the accused persistently
denies his guilt, and sometimes in case of disputes over property the
ownership of which is doubtful, and in cases of disputes over the
division line between fields, ordeals or trials are resorted to. The
challenge to an ordeal may come from either the accuser or the accused.
Refusal to accept a challenge means a loss of the case, and the
challenger proceeds as if he had won the case.</p>
<p>If the accused comes unscathed from the ordeal, he has the right to
collect from his accuser the fine for false accusation.</p>
<p>If two people mutually accuse each other, <i lang="ifu">panuyu</i>,
they are both tried by ordeal. If both be scathed, they are mutually
responsible for the indemnity to the injured person. If only one be
scathed, he is responsible for the indemnity to the injured person and
for a payment of the fine for false accusation to the one whom he
accused.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8258src" href="#xd20e8258" name=
"xd20e8258src">3</a></p>
<p id="s128">128. <i>The hot water ordeal.</i>&mdash;A pot, a foot or
more in depth, is filled with water and heated to a furious boiling. A
pebble is dropped into it. The accused must reach his hand into the
water without undue haste, extract the pebble, and then replace it.
Undue haste is interpreted as a confession of guilt. This ordeal is
used in certain sections of Ifugao, while in others the hot bolo test
is used. It is interesting to note that neither of them is efficacious
in determining accusations of adultery. This is for the reason that the
gods of animal fertility and growth do not permit an accused to receive
an injury <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8272" href="#xd20e8272"
name="xd20e8272">97</a>]</span>for that act which is so eminently
useful in their particular sphere of activity. Thus, Ifugao religion
looks with the greatest disfavor upon things which tend to restrict
population, just as our law frowns upon statutes in restriction of
marriage.</p>
<p id="s129">129. <i>The hot bolo ordeal.</i>&mdash;In this, if two
persons mutually accuse each other, their hands are placed side by
side. The <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> lowers a hot knife on their hands.
The knife burns the guilty person much more seriously than the
guiltless one. If only one person be put to the test, it is said that
the knife bends away from the hands of an innocent person. The <i lang=
"ifu">monkalun</i>, with all his might, it is said, cannot put the
knife down on the hand: the gods of war and justice will not permit it.
But if the person be guilty, the knife grips the hand in its eagerness.
If the accused show fear and try to withdraw, the kin of the accuser
may catch him and burn him well. I know a man whose fingers were burned
off in this way, the thumb adhering to and coalescing with the
palm.</p>
<p id="s130">130. <i>The alao or duel.</i>&mdash;Eggs, <i>runo</i>
stalks, or spears are used in trials, the accused facing each other
and, at the word of the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i>, hurling their
missiles. The duel is not without its dangers. Even though eggs or
<i>runos</i> be used, the one struck is likely to return a stone; and
from throwing stones to throwing spears is an easy step. The two
parties of kin are likely to take a hand. How much more likely are they
to take a hand and avenge their kinsman if spears be the missiles and
he be wounded!</p>
<p>The duel is used in cases of adultery, sorcery, and in some disputes
over rice fields, everywhere in Ifugao. In adultery cases, only eggs
are used in the duel.</p>
<p id="s131">131. <i>Trial by bultong or wrestling.</i>&mdash;This
ordeal is used throughout Ifugao, pre&euml;minently to settle cases of
disputed rice-field boundaries.</p>
<p>The Ifugao clearly recognizes that the processes of
nature&mdash;landslides, the erosion of rainfall in wet weather, and
caking and crumbling in dry weather&mdash;tend to wear away a terrace
not maintained by a stone wall. A terrace maintained by a stone wall is
a rarity in the Kiangan district. Should the boundary not be well
marked by <i lang="ifu">pagbok</i> (see <a href="#s43">sec. 43</a>) a
dispute is nearly sure to result sooner or later. These disputes are
usually settled by wrestling matches. The wrestling matches are usually
friendly. The Ifugao believes that the ancestral spirits of the
controversants know which party is in the right, that they know just
where the true boundary is, and that they see to it that he who is
right shall win, provided always that they be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8314" href="#xd20e8314" name=
"xd20e8314">98</a>]</span>invoked with the proper sacrifices; and that
they &ldquo;hold up&rdquo; even the weaker of the wrestlers, and cause
him to win, provided his cause be just. Notwithstanding this belief,
the people are sufficiently practical to demand that the wrestlers be
approximately evenly matched. The owners of the adjacent fields may
themselves wrestle, or they may choose champions to represent them.
Between kinsmen these matches are presumably friendly; and only
sacrifices of dried meat are offered the ancestral spirits. But between
those not related, there is often a great deal of unfriendly feeling.
In this latter case numerous chickens and two or three pigs are
sacrificed, and ceremonies like those against enemies are
performed.</p>
<p>On the appointed day the two parties meet at the disputed boundary
and occupy opposite ends of the disputed land. A party of mutual kin
follows along and occupies a position midway between the adversaries.
With each party is one of the family priests. Taking betels and dried
meat (presuming the contest to be a friendly one) from a head-basket,
the priest prays very much as follows: &ldquo;Come, Grandfather Eagle,
Grandfather Red Ant, Grandfather Strong &ldquo;Wind, Grandfather
Pangalina; come, Grandmother Cicada, Grandmother Made Happy,
Grandmother Ortagon; come, Grandfather Gold, etc. [throughout a list of
perhaps a hundred ancestors]. Here are betels and meat; they are trying
to take our field away from us. And was it here, Grandmother
Grasshopper, that the boundary of the field was? No, you know that it
was a double arm&rsquo;s length to the right. Hold us up, you
ancestors, in order that <i>we</i> may be the wearers of gold
neck-ornaments; in order that <i>we</i> may be the ones who give
expensive feasts. Exhort [here the priest names over the gods of war
and justice] to hold us up. Was it here, Grandfather Brave, that the
boundary was when you bought the field? Do not let them take our land
away from us, for we are to be pitied. We are sorely tried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the prayers of the priests, each champion is led by one of his
kinsman to the place where the first wrestling is to occur. This
leading is very ceremoniously done, and suggests the heralding of the
champions in feudal days. The dike of the upper terrace has been
cleaned off at intervals of fifteen to twenty-five feet in order that
the owner of the upper field may have no advantage. The champions
frequently work themselves down half-thigh deep in rice-field mud,
water, and slime. Catching fair and even holds, they begin to wrestle,
encouraged each by the shouts and cries of his kinsmen and by the
calling of the old men and old women on the spirits of the ancestors.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8327" href="#xd20e8327" name=
"xd20e8327">99</a>]</span>Each wrestler tries to push his opponent into
the territory that that opponent is defending and to down him there. If
A throws B in B&rsquo;s field, ten feet from the line on which they
wrestle, A wins ten feet of the rice field at that point. Finally,
there is a fall that more than likely capsizes one or both of them in
the black mud. One point in the boundary is determined. Frequently the
lower terrace is eight or ten feet lower than the upper one, but there
are no injuries for the reason that the mud is at least two feet deep
and is a soft place in which to fall.</p>
<p>At every fifteen or twenty feet along the disputed boundary there is
another wrestling match. Sometimes the champions are changed. The new
boundary runs through every point at which there has been a fall.</p>
<p id="s132">132. <i>The umpire and the decision.</i>&mdash;The
<i>monkalun</i> is the umpire in trials by ordeal. He interprets undue
haste or a faulty performance as a confession of guilt. On the day
following the trial by fire or hot water he goes to the house of the
accused and examines the hand and forearm. If he finds white inflamed
blisters, he pronounces him guilty. In the case of a duel, he
pronounces the one struck by the missile guilty. The Ifugaos believe
that the gods of war and justice turn missiles aside from the innocent
in these duels. For the umpire to be manifestly unfair, would be for
him seriously to imperil his own life.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, a person whose skin is rough, dry, and horny
has a great advantage in these ordeals. Since sword climbing and the
walking on hot stones and live coals have occurred in other parts of
the world, it would seem that a question might be raised whether
<i>state of mind</i>, or other factors as yet unexplained, may not
enter these affairs.</p>

<h3 class="main">Execution of Justice</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s133" class="first">133. <i>Retaliation.</i>&mdash;In the case
of lives lost in feuds, sorcery, murders, and head-hunting, capital
punishment inevitably follows, provided the kin of the slain be
sufficiently daring to execute it.</p>
<p>Capital punishment is the rule, and is almost invariably inflicted
in cases of the refusal to pay proper fines, for which demand has been
made in correct form, and after a reasonable length of time has been
given in which to raise the sum demanded, in punishment of adultery,
manslaughter, the putting of another in the position of an accomplice
in case of murder or death in feud, or for wounds, provided the culprit
be not a kinsman or person closely related by marriage. Rarely would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8354" href="#xd20e8354" name=
"xd20e8354">100</a>]</span>there be much trifling in the infliction of
this penalty. Seizure of something of sufficient value to cover the
fine assessed might sometimes be made, except in the cases of adultery
and manslaughter. To practice seizure in the case of
adultery&mdash;except when a kinsman were the offender&mdash;would have
the aspect of anxiety to profit by the pollution of the wife&rsquo;s
body and might give rise to suspicion of conspiracy on the part of
husband and wife to bring about the crime in order to profit
financially. In the same way, a self-respecting family would disdain to
accept payment for the life of a kinsman except as a matter of
forbearance and mercy to the taker thereof. We have seen before that
unless the <i lang="ifu">tokom</i> be collected the injured person is
in danger of losing his own life should he not slay him from whom the
<i lang="ifu">tomok</i> is due.</p>
<p>The crime of arson undoubtedly justifies the death penalty; but it
is so rare a crime that it is impossible to say what is the usual
Ifugao practice in punishing it.</p>
<p>The non-payment of a debt when there is the ability to pay it, and
after many and repeated demands have been made in the proper manner for
it, justifies the infliction of the death penalty.</p>
<p>Capital punishment is administered by the injured person and his
kin. In all cases it is fraught with the greatest danger to the
inflicters. Usually it is inflicted from ambush, although it may be a
sudden slaying in the heat of passion. The culprit is never notified
that he has been sentenced to death. The withdrawal of a go-between
from a serious case is, however, a pretty good warning. It has about
the same significance as the withdrawal of an embassy in an
international complication.</p>
<p>The infliction of a death penalty has been the starting point of
many an interminable feud between families. For this reason the injured
person exhausts every effort to effect a punishment in some other way
if any other punishment be consistent with his dignity and
respectability.</p>
<p id="s134">134. <i>Seizure of chattels.</i>&mdash;If a kinsman of
remoter kinship than that existing between brothers commit a crime
punishable by death, except sorcery or murder, and obstinately refuse
to pay the fine assessed, seizure of his property or part of it is
made.</p>
<p>Seizures are made from unrelated persons to cover fines due in
punishment of theft, malicious killing of animals, arson, and the minor
crimes, also to secure payment of a debt.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the things usually seized: gongs,
rice-wine jars, carabaos, gold beads, rice fields, children, wives.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8379" href="#xd20e8379" name=
"xd20e8379">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>A seizure may be made by fraud or deceit, or it may be made in the
absence of the owner of his household, or it may be made by superior
force. Considering only the manner of the seizure, there is but one law
to be followed: the seizure must be made in such a manner as to leave
no doubt as to the identity of him who seizes. Thus if B persistently
refuses to pay a fine owed to A, A may go to B&rsquo;s house when there
is nobody at home and may run away with a gong. If he leaves his bolo,
his scabbard, his blanket or some other personal effect in the house as
a sort of a visiting card, his seizure is legal. Or A may go to
B&rsquo;s house and, pretending friendship, borrow the gong,
representing that he wants to play it at a feast and, having secured
possession of it, refuse to return it till the fine be paid. Or suppose
that an agent of B&rsquo;s is bringing a carabao up from Nueva Vizcaya,
and that the agent has to travel through A&rsquo;s village. A and his
friends stop the agent and take the carabao away from him, telling him
to inform B that the carabao will be delivered to him when the fine is
paid.</p>
<p>There is a second kind of seizure, a seizure of the property of some
relative or kinsman of the culprit. The property of a wealthy kinsman
may be seized to cover a fine due from a poor kinsman who has no
property. This kind of seizure is more likely to lead to a lance
throwing than a seizure from the culprit himself. The danger of such an
ending increases with the remoteness of the kinship between the culprit
and the person from whom the seizure is made.</p>
<p>A third kind of seizure is practiced against neighbors of
delinquents who live in another district. Suppose a man B in one of the
districts to the west of Kiangan to have gone to Nueva Vizcaya (east of
Kiangan) and there to have purchased a carabao. He owes no debts, nor
have any fines been levied against him. He returns through Kiangan,
however, and his carabao is seized by A, a Kianganite. B is informed
that C, a resident of the same district as he, stole a pig a year or
two ago from A. The evidence against C is placed before him in the
minutest details. He is given thirty pesos as <i lang="ifu">patang</i>
(interest in advance) and told to collect from C the payment proper to
the case, and in addition the thirty pesos advanced as <i lang=
"ifu">patang</i>. When he makes these collections, and delivers them to
A, he gets back his carabao. If C is innocent of the crime charged, he
may kill A for this, or he may do so even if guilty. More likely he
kidnaps A&rsquo;s wife or child and sells them for a ransom
sufficiently great to repay B, and leave a substantial surplus for
himself. A may or may not retaliate with the lance. <span class=

<p>In quarrels between <i lang="ifu">kadangyang</i> (for their dignity
is very dear to them) and between persons of different districts or
contrary parties, it is more frequently than not the case that the
thing seized is not returned. Powerful individuals in a district are
rather glad to have a seizure made of their property, since they can
nearly always manage to come out winner in the finish. Thus in the case
above, B, if a powerful individual, probably collects two or even three
carabaos or their equivalent value from C, and besides he receives
thirty pesos <i lang="ifu">patang</i>. It would seem that the
obligation rests on every Ifugao&mdash;notwithstanding there is no
political government&mdash;so to conduct himself as not to involve his
neighbors in trouble with individuals of inimical or semi-inimical
districts; and that should he so involve them, he is liable to whatever
punishment circumstance metes out to him.</p>
<p>In the case of altercations between individuals of different
districts, seizure of animals was generally practiced by persons of
those districts through which the road led to the region from which the
animals were imported. Of all districts, Kiangan was most
advantageously situated in respect to this matter; since, for the
greater part of Ifugao-land, the road to Nueva Vizcaya (whence most of
the animals imported into Ifugao came) led through it.</p>
<p id="s135">135. <i>Seizure of rice fields.</i>&mdash;The seizure of
rice fields is practicable only in case the fields are near the village
of him who seizes them. For if located in a distant district, the
working of the field would be extremely hazardous, and its protection
and continuous holding impossible.</p>
<p>Fields may properly be seized for collection of debt or for refusal
to pay fines or indemnities. Portions of fields are seized sometimes in
disputes as to ownership or boundaries.</p>
<p>Disputes over ownership and boundary come to a head during spading
time. One party begins to spade for the next year&rsquo;s crop the land
claimed by the other. The other party sticks up <i>runos</i>, tied
&ldquo;ethics lock&rdquo; fashion (<i lang="ifu">alpud</i>), along the
line which he claims to be the true boundary. The first party then
pulls up these <i>runos</i>, and sticks down others along the line
claimed by it as the true boundary. The issue is joined. The defendant
has made his &ldquo;rejoinder.&rdquo; A <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> is
now selected by the plaintiff party, and tries to arrange&mdash;and in
case of disputed boundaries nearly always does arrange&mdash;a means of
peaceful settlement, either by compromise or through trial by
wrestling. Sometimes the ownership of a field itself is in question.
Usually the question is one of inheritance; although there are a number
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8425" href="#xd20e8425" name=
"xd20e8425">103</a>]</span>of other causes that may give rise to
dispute.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8428src" href="#xd20e8428" name=
"xd20e8428src">4</a> Ownership is usually peaceably settled by means of
a wrestling match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come now to those cases in which a field is seized for
debt as payment of a fine or indemnity. The plaintiff or prosecutor
seizes the field at spading time by planting <i>runo</i> stalks,
<i lang="ifu">alpud</i>, in it. The defendant probably pulls up these
stalks and throws them away.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8439src" href=
"#xd20e8439" name="xd20e8439src">5</a> An attempt may be made by mutual
friends and relatives to secure a peaceful settlement of the trouble. A
rice field is a thing so dear to the Ifugao, and so necessary and
useful to him, that such attempts are extremely likely, however, to
come to naught.</p>
<p>If the matter be not arranged otherwise, the seizer of the field
sends a body of men to spade it, holding in reserve an armed force of
kinsmen and relatives to protect and maintain the spaders if they be
attacked. The other party emerges with an armed force to drive the
spaders away. The two parties meet. If one be greatly superior in
strength, the other usually retires, and surrenders the field. If they
be fairly evenly matched, a battle is likely to ensue. If the first
wound be a slight one, the party receiving it is likely to withdraw;
but if it be serious, or if one of their number be killed, they fight
to avenge him. Sometimes four or five men are killed in one of these
frays.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, and often before actual fighting begins, a body
of mutual relatives, friends, and neighbors emerges and tries to make
peace and secure an amicable settlement.</p>
<p id="s136">136. <i>Enforced hospitality.</i>&mdash;Sometimes a
creditor and a numerous and powerful following of kinsmen descend upon
a debtor&rsquo;s house as unwelcome guests, consume his stores of food,
and force his hospitality until appeased by the payment of the
debt.</p>
<p>This form of collection can only be used in the case of debts, for
in all other controversies, taboos forbid the eating of the
adversary&rsquo;s food, drinking his water, chewing his betels, etc.
Even in the case of debt, if a go-between has been sent to the debtor,
this means may not be used. It can only be used in a case where
&ldquo;diplomatic relations&rdquo; have not been ruptured. <span class=

<p id="s137">137. <i>Kidnapping or seizure of
persons.</i>&mdash;Interior districts had no opportunity to seize
animals from those districts nearer than they to the region whence
animals were imported. Of necessity, then, they kidnapped and sold or
held for ransom women and children from those districts.</p>
<p id="s138">138. <i>Cases illustrating seizure and
kidnapping.</i>&mdash;The following instances actually occurred in
times past. They are excellent and veritable illustrations of this
phase of Ifugao administration of justice:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Bahni of Tupplak spoke scornfully of Bumidang of
Palao. Some time subsequently he sent a man to buy carabaos in Nueva
Vizcaya. The man bought two, and returned on the homeward journey,
traveling through Palao. Bumidang took one of the carabaos away from
him there, and with his kin, killed it and ate it. Bahni with his kin
shortly afterward went to the house of Dulauwan of Bangauwan, a
neighboring village, and stole away with Dulauwan&rsquo;s carabao.
Dulauwan followed after them, hotfoot, and was given as <i lang=
"ifu">patang</i> three pigs, and told to collect his carabao from
Bumidang. Dulauwan gathered together a great host of kinsmen and
neighbors, descended on Bumidang&rsquo;s house, and camped there
demanding three carabaos. To show that they meant to get them, they
helped themselves to rice needed for their daily food from
Bumidang&rsquo;s granary. Bumidang was unable to get together a
sufficient force to frighten away his guests, and accordingly he paid
the three carabaos.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Ginnid of Umbul presented a demand to Guade for the payment of a
long-outstanding debt. Guade denied that the debt was owed. Ginnid
seized Guade&rsquo;s field. Each party led a force of kinsmen to the
field. There they fought with spears and shields. The first man wounded
was Tului of Pingungan, a kinsman of Guade. He received a slight wound.
Guade&rsquo;s party then withdrew. Guade paid the debt, and got his
field back.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Gumangan of Ambabag when a youth, sent an advocate to ask for the
hand of the daughter of M of Umbul. He was accepted. But he changed his
mind about the girl, and went to Baininan, where he engaged himself to
a girl of that village without assuaging the mental agony of his jilted
fianc&eacute;e by paying the <i lang="ifu">hudhud</i> indemnity. M
seized a carabao belonging to Gumangan. Gumangan gathered together his
kin and went to Umbul&mdash;only a quarter of a mile distant&mdash;to
prevent the slaughter of his animal. But M&rsquo;s party was so much
more powerful that Gumangan&rsquo;s kin ran away. M&rsquo;s party then
killed and ate the carabao.</p>
<p>Gumangan married in Baininan, and bearing in mind his former
humiliation, decided to do something that would restore his prestige
and at the same time assure him a sufficiently large body of followers
to make him strong to demand and to resist demands. He consequently
gave a great <i lang="ifu">uyauwe</i> feast at which the unheard of
number of six carabaos was slaughtered, to say nothing of innumerable
pigs. And later, he gave the <i lang="ifu">hagabi</i> feast&mdash;an
even more expensive operation.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Dumalilon of Tupplak borrowed a carabao of Gumangan. Five years
elapsed, yet he made no move to repay the debt, notwithstanding
repeated demands of Gumangan. Gumangan seized Dumalilon&rsquo;s field,
which had already been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8494" href=
"#xd20e8494" name="xd20e8494">105</a>]</span>spaded, and threw his
seed-bed away. Both men led armed parties to the field, but this time
Gumangan was careful to have a sufficient number of backers on hand.
Dumalilon&rsquo;s party took to flight.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>In Burnai, a fight occurred over the seizure of a rice field that
resulted in the killing of four men.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Kodamon of Pindungan and Katiling of Ambabag<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8504src" href="#xd20e8504" name="xd20e8504src">6</a> had a
dispute over the boundary of a field. There were <i lang=
"ifu">paghok</i> to mark the boundary, but Kodamon contended that all
memory of the planting of the <i lang="ifu">paghok</i> was absent, and
that they were, consequently, without significance in the matter of
dispute. They wrestled, and Kodamon lost a little ground, but Katiling
tried to take more than was due him according to the verdict of the
wrestling matches. Katiling sent men to spade the disputed territory,
and led an armed force out to support them. Kodamon led an armed force
to the field. At the same time and at a safe distance, the mutual kin
of the two parties and a goodly number of neighbors gathered. Kodamon
was armed with a Remington rifle whose trigger was broken; Dulinayan, a
kinsman of Katiling, with a revolver for which he had no ammunition.
The other members of each force however were substantially, if less
spectacularly, armed with spears which they well knew how to use. Women
rushed in between the two parties, and catching the warriors by the
waist tried to lead them away. One can well believe that the air was
riven by curses, threats, accusations, upbraidings, imprecations,
invocations. The male neutral kin shouted from their safe distance that
if Kodamon killed Katiling, they would kill Kodamon (as a vengeance for
the death of their kinsman) while if Katiling killed Kodamon, they
would avenge their kinsman&rsquo;s death by killing Katiling.
&ldquo;What kind of a way is this for co-villagers to settle a
dispute,&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;Go back home and beget some
children, and marry them to each other, giving them the two fields, and
then it will make no difference where the division line is!&rdquo;
There was an exchange of spears in which Buaya, a kinsman of
Kodamon&rsquo;s, was wounded slightly. The matter was then left in
abeyance with the understanding that as soon as possible, the two
families be united by a marriage, and the two fields given the married
couple.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that on account, of the sexes of the unmarried
children of the families, a union between them was impossible.
Accordingly, Kodamon gave his field to his son Dulnuan, and Katiling
traded his field to Pingkihan, his brother. Both of these young men had
pregnant wives. Pingkihan&rsquo;s wife gave birth first, the child
being a girl. Shortly afterward, Dulnuan&rsquo;s wife gave birth. I met
Dulnuan, and not knowing of the event, and noticing that he seemed
downcast, asked him why he was so sad. &ldquo;My wife has given birth
to a <i>girl</i> baby,&rdquo; he said. The quarrel over the boundary is
as yet unsettled.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Kuyapi of Nagakaran, before the Spanish occupation, sent a slave
child to Guminigin of Baay, to be sold in Baliwan (Nueva Vizcaya),
stipulating that the child must bring at least five carabaos. Guminigin
sold the child for seven carabaos, delivering five to Kuyapi, and kept
two.</p>
<p>The Spaniards came. They were exceedingly partial to the people of
Kiangan district in which the village of Baay is located. They paid
little or no attention to complaints of people of other districts
against people of Kiangan district. Many debts owed by Kiangan people
were unpaid, for the Kianganites <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e8524" href="#xd20e8524" name="xd20e8524">106</a>]</span>took
advantage of the protection given them by the Spaniards. And yet the
Nagakaranites and Kianganites were very closely united by marriage and
by blood. Indeed Kuyapi and Guminigin were second or third cousins.</p>
<p>Owing to the difficulty the Nagakaran people had in collecting debts
owed them by the Kianganites, they conceived for the latter and for the
Spaniards a most violent hatred, and began to make reprisals. The
Spaniards punished these reprisals by making an expedition to Nagakaran
in which they came off second best.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8528src"
href="#xd20e8528" name="xd20e8528src">7</a> They sent another and
stronger expedition, which killed a number of people and which burned
all the houses in the district. To this day the Nagakaran people have
not been able to rebuild their houses&mdash;the large trees having long
since been cut from nearby forests&mdash;and live in wretched shacks
built on the ground. They blame the Kiangan people, saying that the
latter invited the Spaniards into Ifugao.</p>
<p>Kuyapi claimed that the terms on which he sent the slave to
Guminigin were that Guminigin was to receive only one carabao for
having effected a sale, and that all the rest were to be delivered to
him, and that there was consequently a carabao still due him. It seems
likely that the claim was false, and that it was advanced merely as an
excuse for making a reprisal.</p>
<p>Pagadut, the son of Guminigin, to whom demand was presented for the
payment of the carabao claimed to be yet due, refused to pay this debt.
The Nagakaran people made an expedition into Kiangan district (about
two miles distant) and captured Ormaya, the daughter of Pagadut, a very
comely girl of sixteen or seventeen. In order to make her walk, and in
order that she should not continually offer resistance, they took her
skirt off so that she would have to cover her shame with her hands and
would also hurry to arrive at the journey&rsquo;s end.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e8536src" href="#xd20e8536" name="xd20e8536src">8</a>
But the Baay people managed to cut off Lubbut the son of Kuyapi, and
imprison him. They took him to a granary in Baay, intending to keep him
as a hostage for the return of Ormaya. But word was carried to the ears
of the Spanish <i lang="es">commandante</i> of this capture. He had
Lubbut brought before him. He struck Lubbut, tied although he was,
twice in the face, and would have continued, had not Alangwauwi the
husband of Ormaya seized and held his arm and beseeched him not to use
Lubbut harshly. The <i lang="es">commandante</i> promised not to take
his life. But a soldier called attention to the fact that a gun had
been captured with Lubbut, which gun, it was claimed, was that of a
Spanish corporal whom the Nagakaran people had killed. Alangwauwi and
his companions started back to their homes in Baay. But on the road,
they saw, across the valley, Lubbut with his back turned to a firing
squad, saw a puff of white smoke, and saw Lubbut fall into a rice
field. Alangwauwi says he burst into tears for he realized that this
meant serious trouble for him and his relatives, and placed
Ormaya&rsquo;s life in the greatest peril.</p>
<p>When the Nagakaranites heard of Lubbut&rsquo;s death, they at first
blamed the people of Baay for it. Inasmuch as it is against the ethics
of people of the Kiangan-Nagakaran-Maggok area to kill women, or at
least to kill any but Silipan women, they considered walling Ormaya up
in a sepulchre and leaving her to die for want of food and drink. The
women relatives of Lubbut wanted very much to kill Ormaya, and pointed
out that while it would not be permissible for the men to kill her,
there would be no disgrace in their doing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e8547" href="#xd20e8547" name="xd20e8547">107</a>]</span>so. But
Kuyapi would have none of it. He himself guarded his prisoner two or
three nights to see that her life was not taken.</p>
<p>Soon a <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> was sent to ascertain the true
details of Lubbut&rsquo;s death. His report exonerated the Baay people.
The Nagakaran people held Ormaya&rsquo;s ransom considerably higher,
however, because of that death. They received five carabaos, twenty
pigs, two gold beads, and a great number of spears and bolos, and death
blankets. It was five months before the Baay people could raise the
amount of this ransom. During this time, Ormaya was well
treated&mdash;for was she not a kinswoman?&mdash;but she was carefully
guarded.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Paowa or Truce</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s139" class="first">139. <i>The usual sense of the term
&ldquo;paowa&rdquo;.</i>&mdash;The word <i lang="ifu">paowa</i> means
literally prohibition. As most commonly used, it denotes a period of
truce imposed by the <i>monkalun</i> in cases that cannot be peaceably
arranged. It is a period that gives both sides to a controversy a
chance to cool off. It avoids that rash and ill-considered action that
would be likely to follow the breaking off of diplomatic relations
between the two parties.</p>
<p>I say the <i lang="ifu">paowa</i> serves these purposes. However, it
is imposed by the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i> in order to allow him to
withdraw with dignity from the case, and without loss of reputation. A
lance throwing or a seizure made while he is acting as <i lang=
"ifu">monkalun</i> or occurring soon after he has severed his
connection with the case is an insult to him. People say to him:
<i lang="ifu">Dinalan-da tolban-mo</i>, &ldquo;they went over your
head.&rdquo; Such an occurrence is exceedingly hurtful to his
reputation. People will not employ him as <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i>
for the reason that his cases do not end in peaceable settlements. He
thus loses many fat fees.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Ifugao&rsquo;s culture would some day, if left
alone, develop courts somewhat after the fashion of the courts of
civilized nations, have we not here the embryo of &ldquo;contempt of
court&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The period usually set by the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i>, as truce,
is fourteen days. During this time, should one of the parties to the
controversy commit any act hostile to the other, the <i lang=
"ifu">monkalun</i> must avenge or punish it. At the conclusion of this
period of truce, the two parties may fight out the dispute to suit
themselves, kidnapping, seizing property, or hurling lances, without
injuring the dignity of the <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i>; or the
aggressive party may employ another <i lang="ifu">monkalun</i>.</p>
<p id="s140">140. <i>Another sense of the term
&ldquo;paowa&rdquo;.</i>&mdash;Should a wife have committed a crime
against the marital relation, and should her husband be unable for any
reason to collect the <i>gibu</i> due him in the case, he may put a
prohibition on her marrying any other man until the <i>gibu</i> be
paid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8613" href="#xd20e8613" name=

<h3 class="main">Termination of Controversies: Peace-making</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p id="s141" class="first">141. <i>The hidit or religious aspects of
peace-making.</i>&mdash;The word <i lang="ifu">hidit</i> has three
senses: It refers to a class of deities, the offspring of one of the
principal deities of war; it refers to sacrifices to these deities; it
refers to peace-making. Deities, sacrifice, and peace may seem widely
distinct, but a glance into the Ifugao&rsquo;s religion will show the
connection.</p>
<p>The <i lang="ifu">hidit</i> (deities) desire peace: but the peace
must be made in the proper manner, and accompanied by sacrifice to
themselves. The <i lang="ifu">hidit</i> have established the taboo that
those who are involved in a controversy or enmity must not chew betels
with an adversary, nor be in the same house or gathering or feast with
him, nor drink with him, nor receive gifts or hospitality from him. The
penalty for breaking this taboo is the affliction by the <i lang=
"ifu">hidit</i> with diseases of the lungs, throat, voice; the
condition known as &ldquo;big belly,&rdquo; <i>leukaemia</i>, short
wind, swelling of the feet, dropsy, etc. This may be said to be the
punishment for making peace without ceremonies. But sometimes the
<i lang="ifu">hidit</i> punish the prolongation of a feud, enmity or
controversy, by afflicting one or both of the parties as set forth
above. Those who are involved in long enmities sacrifice continually to
the <i lang="ifu">hidit</i> in order to offstand such affliction.</p>
<p>The <i lang="ifu">hidit</i> or peace-making ceremony is performed in
the following cases:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) At the termination of the funeral of a married person. It
is performed between the kin of the dead spouse and between those of
the living spouse.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Between adversaries in case of adultery, rape of married
woman, sorcery, murder, manslaughter, malicious killing of animals,
false accusation, disputes over rice fields, theft (sometimes), or
other serious controversy, <i>provided</i> the controversy terminate
peaceably.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) At the peaceful termination of all ordeals and
trials.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Between the kin of a dead spouse and the widow or widower
on occasion of remarriage of the latter.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Between parties to a controversy ending in payment of the
<i>tokom</i> fine.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) At the termination of a feud, between the families
involved in the feud. A feud was rarely&mdash;my belief is that it was
never&mdash;terminated except by a marriage or on request of one of the
members of the family afflicted by the <i lang="ifu">hidit</i> deities.
In the latter case, peace might or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e8690" href="#xd20e8690" name="xd20e8690">109</a>]</span>might not
be purchased. At any rate, the family suing for peace furnished the
animals for sacrifice.</p>
<p>In most parts&mdash;I believe all&mdash;of Ifugao, peace was never
made between <i>districts</i> or <i>villages</i>. Peace was always made
between <i>families</i>; but peace between the principal families of
two villages or districts was sometimes <i>in effect</i> a peace
between the districts or villages involved&mdash;I say <i>sometimes</i>
because such a peace was uncertain and undependable.</p>
<p>When peace was made between families of different districts, or
between families of the same district in cases of serious controversy,
two men were chosen, one by each party to the peace, and with
appropriate prayers and ceremonies, were given good spears. It was
understood always that these spears were for the purpose of killing the
first one of either party who reopened the feud, war, or controversy.
After this ceremony, other spears were broken and tied together as a
symbol of the breaking and tying up of all enmity; as a symbol, too,
that spears were no longer needed.</p>

<p id="s142" class="first">142. <i>Neutrality.</i>&mdash;When a war
expedition or party passed through a village <i>en route</i> against
another village, the intermediate village might signify its neutrality
by casting a spear at the party. The spear never struck a member of the
party, of course, nor was its casting taken as an unfriendly act. It
was merely a declaration of neutrality. Should a village fail to cast a
spear in these circumstances at such a party, the people of it would be
held as enemies and accomplices of the members of the war party.

ceremony consists in placing an egg or areca nut on the edge of a knife
or the bevel of a spear and repeating the prayers necessary to make the
egg or areca nut balance and stand on end at the mention of the guilty
person. Another form consists in spanning an <i lang="ifu">agba</i>

revealed by its length in relation to the span of the priest. These
sticks are kept for generations. Many of them are over a hundred years

he appealed to the lieutenant-governor, nevertheless, he was so
confident, being in the right, that he would not lose, that he

<h3 class="main">Appendix 2: Connection of Religion with Procedure</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>An Ifugao myth.</i>&mdash;Partly because of its
connection with the Ifugao marriage ceremony, partly because it
illustrates so well the use to which the Ifugao puts his
myths&mdash;rarely telling them for amusement, but reciting them in
religious ceremonies as a means to magic&mdash;and partly because it is
so characteristically Ifugao, I have decided to append the following
myth, despite the fact that it might more properly appear in a work on
religion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8817" href="#xd20e8817"
name="xd20e8817">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>Most of the Ifugao&rsquo;s myths have either been invented or if not
invented, changed, for the purpose of affording an analogy to the
solution of the difficulties or misfortunes that confront men today.
The Ifugaos have a myth telling of a great flood, whose only survivors
were a brother and sister&mdash;Balitok and Bugan. In chagrin and shame
because her brother has gotten her with child, Bugan flees into the
East Region to seek destruction from the terrors there. They refuse to
destroy her, but teach her how to take the curse off marriages between
kindred by the sacrifice of two pigs, a male and female of the same
litter. Notice how a flood myth&mdash;an element in the mythology of
nearly every people under the sun&mdash;has been modified and made to
serve a magic purpose.</p>
<p>The myth given below is a further and utterly inconsistent
modification of this flood myth. In the myth above, Balitok and Bugan
are represented as having a child and not wanting it&mdash;in the myth
below, they have no child but want one.</p>
<p>The ceremony of using a myth to serve a religious end consists of
two parts. The first is the recitation of the myth by the priest. This
is called <i lang="ifu">bukad</i>. In affords an analogy to the
condition of sickness, war, famine, harvest, union in marriage, or what
not, in which the performers of the ceremony find themselves, and the
happy solution of the problem. It is terminated by what I term the
<i>fiat</i>. This is an expression of the priest&rsquo;s will that the
happy solution related in the myth shall be existent in the present
situation. It is not, I think, the fact of the priest&rsquo;s will that
is thought to bring about the solution so much as the compelling and
magic power of his spoken word to that end.</p>
<p>Up to this stage, the ceremony is sympathetic magic. In the second
stage it becomes witchcraft, and is called <i lang="ifu">tulud</i>,
&ldquo;pushing.&rdquo; In it the priest &ldquo;pushes&rdquo; the
deities of the myth over the route from their habitations in the
Skyworld, the Underworld, the East Region, the West Region, or
wheresoever they may abide, step by step to the village of the Ifugaos
performing the ceremony. He may recite their passage through as many as
thirty or forty localities, and as the priest drones: &ldquo;They climb
the steep at Nunbalabog; they descend at Baat, they wade at
Monkilkalney,&rdquo; etc., the compelling power of his spoken word
&ldquo;pushes&rdquo; the deities along. Finally the deities arrive and
declare through the priest that they will confer the benefits
requested.</p>
<p>This myth is employed in all of the final ceremonies of marriage,
and in all ceremonies of married persons that have the obtaining of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8837" href="#xd20e8837" name=
"xd20e8837">112</a>]</span>children as their object. The translation is
absolutely literal and without embellishment.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>How Balitok and Bugan obtained
children.</i>&mdash;And it is said that Bugan and Balitok of Kiangan
were childless. &ldquo;What is the use [of living]?&rdquo; said Bugan.
&ldquo;Stay here, Balitok. I am going to go to the East Country. I will
see Ngilin, Umbumabakal, Dauwak, Pinyuhan, Bolang, and the Gods of
Animal Fertility of the East.&rdquo; She got betels together and packed
them. Bugan and Balitok ate. After finishing, they chewed betels.</p>
<p>Bugan put her pack on her head and started. She came to Baladong
[Ligaue Gap]. She went on to Kituman. Went eastward to Ulu. Forded at
Agwatan. Encountered the Fire at Bayukan. He [the Fire] asked,
&ldquo;Where are you going, Bugan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going into the East Region,&rdquo; said Bugan,
&ldquo;because we are childless, Balitok and I. I am going to find some
one to devour me, because we are very lonely.&rdquo; Fire laughed.
&ldquo;Do not feel so, Bugan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep going
eastward until you come to Ngilin, Umbumabakal, and the deities of the
East Region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bugan put her pack on her head and continued to Balahiang. She came
to the lake [or ocean(?)] at Balahiang. She aroused the Crocodile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, human?&rdquo; said the Crocodile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Bugan of Kiangan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why is it,&rdquo; said the Crocodile, &ldquo;although the
Flood of the East Region and the Flood of the West Region came upon me
and fear to arouse me, that you, Bugan, a [mere] human, [presume to]
molest me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bugan, &ldquo;that was my intention; for I
am searching for someone to devour me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said the Crocodile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for I have become very lonely; for Balitok and I have no
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crocodile chuckled. &ldquo;Oh, I will not devour you,
Bugan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would shame to devour one so beautiful.
Continue on eastward, and arrive at the dwelling of the Shark. Wake him
up, in order that he shall be the one to devour you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bugan thought well of it. She put her pack on her head. She went on
eastward and came to the waters where dwells the Shark. It was
fear-inspiring, and caused her to exclaim &ldquo;<i>Inay!</i>&rdquo;
She was terrified, but she conquered her fear. She reached for betels,
and threw them between her teeth. She crushed them. They became like
blood. Bugan spat into the waters. She beheld a great wave circle. The
Shark came into sight. He grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, human?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Bugan, the wife of Balitok at Kiangan,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why is it that you arouse me, human? And there come the
Strong Wind of the East and the Strong Wind of the West, and they
arouse me not; for I am ferocious here in the East Region. Yet you,
Bugan, the wife of Balitok at Kiangan, you arouse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what I purpose,&rdquo; said Bugan, &ldquo;for I
am looking for someone to devour me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Shark chuckled. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for I want to be devoured because Balitok and I have no
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would shame to do so, for you are a beautiful woman. Come
into my house in the Waters in order that we may eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bugan entered. They ate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8886"
href="#xd20e8886" name="xd20e8886">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; said the Shark, &ldquo;into the East Region.
Go unto the dwellings of Umbumabakal and the Gods of Animal
Fertility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bugan rose to the surface of the waters, and on the beach again put
her pack on her head. She continued the journey. She came to Lumbut, to
the house of Umbumabakal. The house was covered with enormous ferns. It
terrified her. She threw betels between her teeth, and put down her
fear. She passed through the gate of the enclosure about the house, and
sat down on the rice mortar. In the evening of the day Umbumabakal came
down. He was looking for something to eat. He passed through the gate.
Bugan hid herself in a large wooden bucket. Umbumabakal kept sniffing
the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that there is something human here now,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;yet nothing of the kind has ever happened
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought for Bugan. He found her in the bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, human, are you here?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Bugan, the wife of Balitok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you come here, Bugan, wife of Balitok?&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I want to be devoured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for we are childless at Kiangan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umbumabakal laughed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;tomorrow we will go to the dwelling of Ngilin and the other Gods
of Animal Fertility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow they visited the various Gods of Animal Fertility.
They gathered pigs and chickens as gifts to Balitok and Bugan.
&ldquo;Return to Kiangan,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We will go with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[At this point, some priests change the myth into a <i lang=
"ifu">tulud</i>, while some continue it as a myth. We will here insert
the method of this change.]</p>
<p>[<i>Fiat</i> by the priest, <i>i.e.</i>, a statement of the
priest&rsquo;s will:] It is not formerly, but now; not to Kiangan that
they come but here to our village of X, in order that they relieve A
and B of childlessness; in order that they increase the life here in
our village of X. They bring children and pigs and chickens and
miraculous increase of rice to A and B here in our village of X.</p>
<p>They return to Lumbut. They come west to Agab. They continue to X.
[Here follows a detailed &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; of the party from the
East Region to the village in which the priest is performing the
invocation, and to the house of the childless couple.] They look up.
&ldquo;Why, it is our children in X,&rdquo; they say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; [says the priest,] &ldquo;for they are childless.
Give them children. Let some be male and some be female. Let there be a
myriad of shields [figuratively: men] and a myriad of <i lang=
"ifu">tudong</i> [women&rsquo;s sweet potato baskets; figuratively:
women] here in our village of X. Let the pigs and the chickens become
many. May the rice be miraculously increased. Bring us much life here
in our village of X.</p>
<p>[If the priest does not change the myth to a <i>tulud</i> at the
point above, he continues it as follows:]</p>
<p>They continued with Bugan to Kiangan. They gathered together the
&ldquo;sitters&rdquo; [priests] at Kiangan. They sacrificed the pigs
and the chickens. The Gods of Animal Fertility taught them how to
perform the bubun ceremony. They divided [as a tribute] the meat with
Ambahing [who takes semen from the womb of women and carries it off in
his hip-bag] and with Komiwa [who stirs up semen in the womb so that
conception is prevented].</p>
<p>Bugan and Balitok <span class="corr" id="xd20e8942" title=
"Source: multipied">multiplied</span> at Kiangan. There came to be a
myriad of shields [men] and a myriad of sweet-potato baskets [women] in
Kiangan. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e8945" href="#xd20e8945"
name="xd20e8945">114</a>]</span>pigs and the chickens became many.
Their children scattered throughout the hills of Pugao [the
Ifugao&rsquo;s earth]. The rice dikes climbed up the mountains. The
hills smoked day by day [from the burning off of clearings for
sweet-potatoes]. Life was miraculously increased.</p>
<p>[<i>Fiat by the priests:</i>] It is not then but now; not in
Kiangan, but here in our village of X. It shall be the same with these
children, A and B. Their children will be many. Let some be male and
some female. Let their pigs and the chickens, etc., etc.</p>
<p>[<i>Tulud.</i>] &ldquo;We will go now,&rdquo; said Umbumabakal.
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Bugan. &ldquo;There is a calling
above,&rdquo; said Ngilin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you kin yonder?&rdquo; said Umbumabakal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bugan, &ldquo;we have kin in the village of
X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us thither,&rdquo; say the Gods of Animal Fertility. They
come westward to Tulbung. They continue to X. [The priest
&ldquo;pushes&rdquo; the deities step by step on the way to the village
in which he is performing the invocation. When they arrive, the same
occurs as shown in the <i lang="ifu">tulud</i> inserted above.]</p>
</div>
<p><i>The halupe feast.</i>&mdash;The <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> are a
class of deities that keep an idea constantly before the mind of one
whom they are sent to harass. They are most frequently used against
debtors; but they may be sent to soften the wrath of an enemy or the
stubbornness of a pretty girl, or for other purposes. They are induced
to serve the end of him who invokes them by the sacrifice of a pig or
chicken and by offerings of betels and rice wine. There are about a
hundred of these deities.</p>
<p>After the ancestral spirits have been invoked, and beseeched to
intercede with the <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> for the purpose desired,
the <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> themselves are invoked, in some such words
as the following:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Ye <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> of the Skyworld, of
the Underworld, of the West Region, and of the East Region, are
beseeched to attend. It is prayed ye that ye go and harass (name) so
that he will not sleep for thinking of his debt to me. If he goes to
get water, go with him; if he goes to get wood, go with him; if he goes
on a trading trip, go with him. Harass him to the extent that he will
give me his pigs, his rice, his chickens, his death blankets, his
money, his rice fields, his &ldquo;irons,&rdquo; his house furnishings:
[There is no danger of asking too much of a deity or a white man!] May
the speech of the go-between make him ashamed to refuse! Do not let him
sleep till he pays the debt.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A subclass of the <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> deities have, for their
especial function, the soothing of obstinate debtors so that they may
not get angry at the words of the go-between, nor run away from him
when they see him coming. These are also invoked.</p>
<p>The priest then is possessed by the <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> one by
one, and through him, each of the <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> takes a sip
of rice wine, and states that he will harass the debtor and that he
will not allow him to sleep till he pays.</p>
<p>After this ceremony, a fowl or pig is sacrificed and given the
<i lang="ifu">halupe</i>. The meat is cooked and spread out on some
cooked rice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e9008" href="#xd20e9008"
name="xd20e9008">115</a>]</span>Myths relating how some ancestor
successfully invoked the <i lang="ifu">halupe</i>, are then recited for
the magic power that lies in the recital, and are followed by <i lang=
"ifu">tulud</i>, ceremonies of witchcraft in which the deities are
&ldquo;pushed along&rdquo; by the compelling power of the word of the
priest to do his bidding. More frequently than not, the myth changes
abruptly into the <i lang="ifu">tulud</i>. The following instance is
taken verbatim from a series of ceremonies that I had a priest perform
against a delinquent debtor who owed me a sum of money. I regret to say
that the ceremonies were not efficacious.</p>

<p><i>Translation.</i>&mdash;And it is said that Tumayaban and Panubok
and Binantawan and Banaban and Dimpuyu of the Skyworld decided to go
hunting there in their region of the Skyworld. They fed their dogs. And
then, indeed, they sent them on the chase. The dogs found a trail. They
started up a wild boar. They chased it about the Skyworld, and followed
down to Pangagauwan [the mountain that towers over Kiangan]. The
<i lang="ifu">halupe</i> [the deities above named] followed after. They
came up with their dogs, and there, it is said, they speared the
quarry. They spread grass on the earth and cut it up. And <i>Halupe</i>
Binantawan asked for fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no flint and steel,&rdquo; said Tumayaban.</p>
<p>And it is said that Bugan, the daughter of Tadona of Kiangan, was
sick of life; for she said, &ldquo;I will beg some one to eat me up in
order that I may forget my debtors who will not pay the debt they owe
me.&rdquo; She set out across the rice fields at Kiangan. Binantawan
saw her and said: &ldquo;Go, Tumayaban; get fire from Bugan.&rdquo;
Tumayaban got up and went to where Bugan was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have fire, Bugan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in a hurry?&rdquo; said Bugan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Tumayaban.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I am tired of life, and am hunting for somebody to eat me
up,&rdquo; said Bugan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Tumayaban.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &ldquo;for I am tired of beseeching my debtors to pay
their debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed, will they not listen to reason?&rdquo; said
Tumayaban. &ldquo;Go back to your house and call upon us <i lang=
"ifu">halupe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bugan returned, and sacrificed chickens, and called upon the
<i lang="ifu">halupe</i>. &ldquo;Let us go, for the daughter of Tadona
has called upon us at Kiangan,&rdquo; said Banaban. [The old Kiangan
about four miles below the village now called Kiangan by American
officials.] &ldquo;They have gathered together in Kiangan. Let us
assist our kinsfolk there.&rdquo; The <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> went and
they harassed those of whom it was asked [the debtors], those who had
borrowed pigs of the kin in Kiangan. And Bugan followed after and took
their pigs and their &ldquo;irons&rdquo; and their money and their
chickens and their rice and their rice fields and their death
blankets.</p>
<p>[The priest blows and waves his hand in the direction of his
debtor&rsquo;s house.]</p>
<p>Let it be so, not at Kiangan, but here, so that I may go in the
morning and take Kodamon&rsquo;s pigs, death blankets, rice fields,
money, chickens. May my words carry shame to him. May I be like a
harasser and like a soother, in order that he pay, in order that it may
be finished, in order that there come no serious result of the

<p>The <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> speak, saying, &ldquo;Let us return to
our village in the Skyworld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a calling,&rdquo; said Tumayaban. &ldquo;Whence
comes this call from above? Have you kin there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bugan, &ldquo;we have kindred
above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the <i lang="ifu">halupe</i> ascend at Tataowang. They come on
to Kulab. They continue to Gitigit. They continue to Pangibautan. They
climb up to Nunbalabog. They listen for a calling at Baay and
Pindungan. [These are villages in the vicinity of Urnbul, the village
where the priest was performing the ceremony.] &ldquo;Aha! the calling
is at Umbul!&rdquo; they say. They walk on the level at Panaangan. They
descend at Iwakal. They come to Upupan. They continue to Tobal. They
come out at Uhat. They wade at Nungimel. They go around the hill to
Boko. They continue to Pugu. They climb at Takadang. They ascend to
Domok. They walk on the level at Palatog. They listen for the calling.
They hear it there. They travel on the rice dikes at Kabonwang. They
wade at Tudunwe. They come round the hill at Umbul. They arrive and,
&ldquo;Why, it is Barton and Patikwal,&rdquo; says Tumayaban.
&ldquo;Where are your refractory debtors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Kodamon. He does not pay his debts to us. Go and
disperse yourselves in the vicinity of his house, and harass him
continually with the remembrance of his debt, so that he may not sleep,
even in the middle of the night. Make him ashamed. Soothe him (so that
he will not be angry). Harass him so that he may think of nothing else
than his debt; so that he will finish with it; so that he will sell his
rice fields (in order to pay); so that he will give us his pigs, his
money, his irons, his rice, and his rice fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[The priest blows and waves his hand in the direction of
Kodamon&rsquo;s house.] &ldquo;Ooo-of! Wait there till I come in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The collector of a large fine performs an unpretentious series of
ceremonies directed to the gods of animal fertility and growth. The
fact that he has won out in collecting the fine shows that his star is
in the ascendancy and that a more pretentious feast is not needed.</p>
<p><i>Peace-making ceremonies.</i>&mdash;A full account of these
ceremonies would be too extended to give here. The following are two of
the myths that are recited in the course of these ceremonies:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">(1) And it is said that the father of Amtalao of the
Skyworld spoke to his son, saying: &ldquo;Go down and cause the enemies
of earth to make peace, in order that there be no longer coughings, and
shortness of breath, and bleedings from the nose, and quick fatigue
among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amtalao packed his betels, put on his hip-bag, and took his spear in
hand. He descended to Habiatan. [Here the myth goes into a detailed
account of the places passed in the journey.] He arrived in Kiangan. He
went to the house of Balitok [the hero ancestor of the people of
Kiangan culture area]. He thrust the shod point of his spear handle
into the flat stone used as a seat in front of the house. It crackled
like a dry leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have spoiled the flat stone,&rdquo; said Balitok. Amtalao
kicked the pieces of stone with his foot. They all joined together as
if never broken apart. &ldquo;I did not spoil it,&rdquo; said
Amtalao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it, Balitok, that you do not make peace with your
enemies? Is it that you wish to be afflicted by the <i lang=
"ifu">hidit</i>?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e9140" href=
"#xd20e9140" name="xd20e9140">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know how,&rdquo; said Balitok. Amtalao went to the
sons of Imbalitayan. &ldquo;Make peace with Balitok, in order that ye
be not afflicted with coughings and snorings and bleedings from the
nose and shortness of the breath,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>And they caught their pigs and chickens, the sons of Imbalitayan,
and the people of Kiangan, and Amtalao taught them to make peace. And
when they had finished, Amtalao ascended into the Skyworld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many did you cause to make peace?&rdquo; said his
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no more enemies on earth,&rdquo; said Amtalao. Even
though the Ifugao travel far, they are safe. Even though spears be
thrown, they do not scathe. No longer is there shortness of the breath,
and labored breathing, bleeding from the nose, and coughings and quick
fatigue. The people are like unto gold, which tarnishes not, like unto
the waters of the river, which never become small, and like unto the
dancing plumes of the <i>cogon</i> and <i>runo</i> grass. They talk and
talk, and talk straight. They ask for what they want and get
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let it be so, not at Kiangan, but here; not then, but now; in order
that there be no more shortness of breath and coughing and labored
breathing [the priest&rsquo;s will being that the benefits mentioned by
Amtalao in the paragraph immediately preceding become existent].</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>(2) The Thunderer of the Skyworld was sitting on his lounging bench
in the Skyworld. &ldquo;Alas! why do the people keep fighting all the
time?&rdquo; he said. He took his spear in hand. He descended unto
Kiangan. He went to the house of Balitok. &ldquo;Why do you not make
peace with the sons of Imbaluog?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire to make peace, but they will not,&rdquo; said
Balitok.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said the Thunderer. They went to the
village of the sons of Imbaluog. The Thunderer shouted to them. They
came down out of their houses, spears in hand, and carrying their
shields. They advanced toward Balitok. The Thunderer was angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did the people of Kiangan offer to make peace, and ye
would not?&rdquo; shouted he. The Thunderer snorted. The branches fell
from the trees. The sons of Imbaluog were blown to pieces. Their limbs
were torn from their trunks and went hurtling hither and thither.</p>
<p>And below every house was heard the wailing of the old women. And
every woman&rsquo;s head was encircled by mourning bands.</p>
<p>Let it be so, not then, but now, with those that do not keep the
peace! Let them be blown to pieces and scattered hither and thither,
and may there be none to avenge them.</p>
</div>
<p>The chewing of betels together by the reconciled enemies is the
essential part of the peace-making ceremony. Three constituents are
used in betel chewing: the betel leaf, the areca nut, and the lime. The
priest takes position between the two (as yet) enemies. One of the
enemies then gives the other an areca nut, and his courtesy is returned
by his enemy giving him a betel leaf. Both are then supplied by the
priest with lime. They proceed to chew betels then, and the priest
prays as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Ye are chewed, Betel Leaf, Areca Nut, and Lime.
Let not them who were enemies be afflicted with coughings, shortness of
breath, quick-coming fatigue, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e9178"
href="#xd20e9178" name="xd20e9178">119</a>]</span>bleeding from the
nose, nor labored breathing. Let them, instead, be like gold, which
tarnishes not; like the tail feathers of the full-grown cock, which
never touch the earth; like the waters of the river, which never cease
coming; like Talal of Ambuaya, who ate his own children, yet was not
afflicted by the <i lang="ifu">hidit</i>. Let them be as active as the
waters of Inude (a cataract) or the feathery plumes of the <i>cogon</i>
and <i>runo</i> grass. Let them be like the rising sun, like the Cobra
of the White Mountain, like the Full-grown Cock of Dotal, like the Hard
Stone of Huduan.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9189src" href="#xd20e9189"
name="xd20e9189src">1</a> May their enemies stand aside from them in
fear. May their valor be heard of in all the hills.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><i>Ceremonies connected with the payment of large
fines.</i>&mdash;At the termination of a controversy in which a large
fine is paid, the two parties perform the <i lang="ifu">hidit</i>,
peace-making ceremonies, as a matter of self-interest. To leave them
unperformed would be to subject themselves to the wrath of the <i lang=
"ifu">hidit</i> deities who would afflict them with tuberculosis,
shortness of breath, etc. The peace so made is theoretical, oftentimes,
rather than actual. Usually there is a great deal of ill feeling
smoldering in the breasts of the controversants.</p>
<p>He who pays any large fine invariably performs a general welfare
feast soon afterward. To this feast he invites all the deities of the
Skyworld, the Underworld, the Fabulous Region of the East and the
Fabulous Region of the West. In addition, if he feels great resentment
against the fine collector, he secretly performs the following
ceremony:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i lang="ifu">Tulud</i> (Pushing).&mdash;&ldquo;The
Ender of the East Region sits on his lounging bench there. He hears a
call. He arises and puts betels in his hip-bag and takes his spear in
hand. He hesitates, and then starts westward. He comes on to Payya.
[The priest &ldquo;pushes&rdquo; him, as in the preceding <i lang=
"ifu">tulud</i>, stage by stage through the following places: Ulikon,
Hapid, Ulalahi, Lana, Kudug, Lingay, Balahiang, Lau, Bayukan, Ula,
Tuktukbayahan, Kituman, Kiangan. From Kiangan onward the route is
variable, depending on the village of the priest.]</p>
<p>He arrives at [village]. He receives the chicken. He chops off its
head. [The priest at this stage chops off the chicken&rsquo;s head.]
Even so [he says] I chop off the life of the fine collector. [The
priest blows and swings his arm in the direction of the
fine-collector&rsquo;s house.] Travel thither, Ender, to the house of
him who took from us the death blankets. Stay with him. If he goes to
get wood, turn the axe into his body. If he travels, push him off the
steep. If he sleeps, sleep with him. In the middle of the night stab
him, and we will hear about it with the rising sun. For we are poverty
stricken. We owed them no debt, yet they have taken our pigs and our
chickens and our death blankets and our rice [etc.]. We are to be
pitied, alas!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Other deities that may be sent against the fine collector are the
Spider-webbed One, the Smotherer, Dysentery, the Short-winded One, the
Trapper, the Twister. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e9218" href=

<h3 class="main">Appendix 3: Parricide</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A rather startling case was called before the Court of
First Instance in Kiangan in December, 1913. Limitit of Ayangan was
charged with having murdered his father. The phrase &ldquo;Are you
guilty or not guilty?&rdquo; translated into Ifugao changes
significance slightly, and stands &ldquo;Are you at fault or not at
fault?&rdquo; With a candor almost pitiable, Limitit admitted the facts
in the case, but pleaded &ldquo;not at fault.&rdquo; &ldquo;He was my
father,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had a right to kill him. I am
blameless, for I provided a generous funeral feast for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interrogation developed that Dilagan, the father, was a spendthrift.
He had raised a sum of money&mdash;possibly for the purpose of
gambling&mdash;by pawning, <i>balal</i>, his son&rsquo;s rice field.
The son was angry, but Dilagan promised faithfully to redeem the field
by planting time. But planting time came round, and Dilagan was unable
to keep his promise and redeem the field. In a quarrel over this
matter, the son lost patience and killed his father. So far as I am
able to ascertain, his act is justified, or at the very least, condoned
by his co-villagers. They excuse him on two grounds:</p>
<p>First, the old man was worthless, and deserved killing for having
wronged his son. Even though the damage done was not irremediable, it
was probable that it would be repeated, and that he would impoverish
his son for life.</p>
<p>Second, the old man was Limitit&rsquo;s father, and Limitit had the
right on that account to kill him if he wanted to; at least <i>it was
the business of nobody else</i>.</p>
<p>The American court, if I remember aright, sentenced Limitit to life
imprisonment. He died shortly after being incarcerated.</p>
<p>Another case of parricide was that of Bayungubung of Kurug. He
killed his father for the same reason that Limitit killed Dilagan: that
is, for the wrongful pawning of a field.</p>
<p>The essence of the attitude of the people in both these cases seemed
to be that the son had the right to kill his father if the latter
imperiled the family livelihood or position in society. It seems to us
an inhuman doctrine. But remember that the be-all and the end-all of
Ifugao existence is the family, and <i>not</i> the individual. With us,
the opposite is true: the rights of the individual supersede those of
the family. The fields in question had been handed down from past
generations. The son in each case was responsible at the time of the
parricide for the welfare of future generations of the family. The old
man in each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e9245" href="#xd20e9245"
name="xd20e9245">121</a>]</span>case was a traitor to the welfare of
the family. He had had his day, and was worse than useless. Remember
that in a country where a living must be eked from a tough, stony
mountain-side with a wooden spade, the means to life handed down from
the sweat of former generations is a thing as sacred, as it is
precious.</p>
<p>Besides these considerations, there is the principle on which Ifugao
society is based: The family exists principally for the youthful and
future generations of it.</p>

<h3 class="main">Appendix 4: Concubinage among the Kalingas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kalingas are a tribe having a culture remarkably
similar to the Ifugao. In respect of warfare, head-hunting, and social
organization, it is an even more dazzling example of a barbarian
culture, I believe. Concubinage is universally practiced by the
wealthy. The concubine has a legal status. A man must secure his
wife&rsquo;s consent to take a concubine, but the consent is
universally forthcoming.</p>
<p>During a six months&rsquo; residence in Kalinga I became quite well
acquainted with the unusually intelligent wife of a Kalinga headman. I
asked her one day why the women permitted their men to take unto
themselves additional wives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the custom of us Kalingas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s the custom. But I think it&rsquo;s a poor
one for you women who are so unfortunate as to be married to men who
practice it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we unfortunate? Their children can inherit none of
his wealth. Our children get it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but doesn&rsquo;t it hurt you to see your husband
running after other women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never see it. The other women never come here. Or if they
do come to the house it is as if they were perfect strangers. They have
their own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must know that your husband does leave you to go to
these other women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! But I don&rsquo;t see it. Besides their children are
subject to my children. If my children suffer injury, they fight to
avenge them. If my children demand, they stand back of them. It is good
to have a large family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The logic of concubinage is embraced in this last reply, I think. It
is an institution to render the family &ldquo;strong to demand, and
strong to resist demands.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd20e9272" href="#xd20e9272" name="xd20e9272">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>A strong healthy Kalinga chief has usually two, often more
concubines. He gives them rather limited material support: now and then
a suckling pig to rear, a little rice to help out the year, work at
good wages, yarn to keep them busy at the loom, a little capital for
trading trips, and the like. He may <i>help</i> them a great deal, but
they rarely cost him much. As indicated above, their children have no
inheritance rights.</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Negrito shack</p>
<p class="first">Often a Negrito&rsquo;s dwelling is the merest mockery
of a house. This is an unusually good one, since it has a thatched
roof. Often the roof is no more than a few curled banana leaves and the
dwelling without walls of any kind. At the side of the door are seen
two or three bows. The Negrito puts into making his bow and arrows all
the pains that he neglects to put into the construction of his
house.</p>

<p class="first">The height of the American is 5 feet 9&frac12; inches.
Many of the Negritos are of mixed blood and consequently the average
height of the tribe is above what one would expect to find in a tribe
of dwarf blacks. These wiry little men are at home in the tropical
jungle. Slipping through it noiselessly and speedily on their quest for
game or on missions of vengeance, they inspire no little fear in their
neighbors. The Ifugaos have quite poignant traditions of the time when
the Negritos lived in the surrounding forests. To this day in the
general welfare ceremonials, they call a deity that is a Negrito
spirit, and address him as follows: &ldquo;We also are Negritos. Do not
shoot us with your bow and arrow. Shoot our enemies instead because we
are all Negritos together.&rdquo;</p>

At one corner of this space beneath the house proper is a tight box in
which husband, wife, and baby, if there be one, sleep. The other

as most other districts of Ifugao. The view is surpassingly beautiful,
combining as it does the rugged mountain ranges, the fields and
huts&mdash;the work of man&mdash;and the palms and feathery bamboos in
the foreground. The picture illustrates a feature that bears out the
statement made in the text as to the Ifugao&rsquo;s skill as a mountain
agriculturist. Note the fields in the right foreground. The hive-shaped
hummocks comprise the superior six inches of the field&rsquo;s soil.
This soil has been heaped up by the women working with their bare hands
in order that it may be a&euml;rated and the decomposition of partially
decayed vegetable matter completed.</p>

<p>This is a terraced mountain side that has excited the admiration and
astonishment of every traveler who has had the hardihood to venture to
its remote location in the interior. The area of rice fields pictured
here is about 12 kilometers long without a break in its continuity.
Some of the terrace walls are 60 feet high. A little to the right of
the middle of the picture and on the fourth or fifth tier of walls
above the river are three human figures which may be used by the reader
to seize some idea of the scale of the picture. Small groups of houses
may also be distinguished on jutting ledges of the mountain side.

<p class="first">This is one of the most stupendous spectacles that the
life of a barbarian people has to offer. The front of the shields is
striped with zigzag white lines. The processions are often a mile long
and 1000 or even 2000 people frequently take part in them. The men wear
gaudy head-dresses, women&rsquo;s beads, and strips of white fiber
about the legs and arms. The participants dance along their way,
turning from one side to the other. Viewed from a distance, one of
these processions as it dances slowly along on a rice-field dike looks
like nothing so much as a gigantic, squirming centipede.</p>

dead from natural causes is very different from the treatment of the
bodies of the murdered or those dead by violence. The former are shown
great care and respect; the latter are neglected and bereft of the
usual dignities of death.</p>
